So I have a [blog on Wordpress](http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com) and I've spent something like a year and a half there, writing silly things and what have you.

I wouldn't say that Wordpress doesn't meet my needs for a blogging service, since I don't post that much and it does a lot of the heavy lifting for me. Wordpress does do significantly more than I need it to, like tags and comments and crazy themes and etc.

Mostly, I just want to take better advantage of my personal URL, and also get my hands dirtier with website management. I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build out the whole blog section of the site, which does do a lot for me in converting folders of Markdown into static HTML, but it's still fun to build out the site itself.

I'll be back-filling posts from my Wordpress blog, so this will eventually only serve as a turning point.

Anywho, welcome, again!
