The biggest thing getting in the way of gay marriage might be the fact that the bureaucracy isn't set up to handle it. [Here](http://qntm.org/gay) is an entertaining look at how a database for marriages of all sorts might look, from the incredibly narrow-minded to the overly permitting.

A thoughtful passage on Go, chess, and backgammon:

> Go begins with an empty board. It is focused on building from the ground up (nothing to something) with multiple, simultaneous battles leading to a point-based win. Chess is tactical rather than strategic, as the predetermined strategy is to kill one individual piece (the king). This comparison has also been applied to military and political history, with Scott Boorman's 1969 book _The Protracted Game_ exploring the strategy of the Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War through the lens of Go.

> A similar comparison has been drawn among Go, chess and backgammon, perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity. Backgammon is a "man vs. fate" contest, with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome. Chess, with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other, embodies the conflict of "man vs. man". Because the handicap system tells Go players where they stand relative to other players, an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games; therefore, Go can be seen as embodying the quest for self-improvement, "man vs. self".

What's unexpected is that this passage comes from [the Go Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)#Comparisons).

[A StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7825055/what-does-the-c-operator-do/7825075) explains the `??!??!` operator in C, which is perfectly valid code.

[The Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), which grades any text you provide it on a readability scale. The app tells you the minimum level of education required to understand your writing. It also tries to find sentences that are hard to read, complicated phrases, adverbs, and passive voice -- and prompts you to change them. I'm trying to use it for my writing, including this very blog post!
