I've been sitting on a bunch of links to interesting things for a while, and there's no better time than now to get them documented.

[A Dismal Guide to Concurrency](http://carlos.bueno.org/2010/04/dismal-guide-to-concurrency.html), a short explanation of the problem with concurrency in computing and a lamentation that there is no concise solution.

[The Minimum Vacation Policy](https://medium.com/@cameronmoll/the-minimum-vacation-policy-15f6c3b922f) -- the company I work for has an unlimited vacation policy, which usually means that people don't take vacations. This is in no way an attack, it's just a curious alternative.

[From Open To Minimum Vacation Policy](http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/12/10/from-open-to-minimum-vacation-policy.html), a story along the same lines.

[Parable of the Polygon: A Playable Post on the Shape of Society](http://ncase.me/polygons/), a particularly well-done explanation of bias, the structure that society tends toward, and diversity. Also, it has cute squares and triangles.

[If Programming Languages were Weapons](http://bjorn.tipling.com/if-programming-languages-were-weapons), an entirely factual (based on all the languages in here that I've used) classification of popular programming languages.

[Happy 20th, Rise of the Triad!](http://joe.siegler.net/2014/12/happy-20th-rise-of-the-triad/). I never played this game, but this was a lot of fun to read about regardless.

[A christmas math puzzle](http://tywkiwdbi.blogspot.com/2014/12/math-puzzle.html). Don't scroll down if you want to give it a shot -- the answer is festive.

[This is How We Date Now](http://thoughtcatalog.com/jamie-varon/2014/12/this-is-how-we-date-now/), a depressing yet honest view on relationships and love. Of course not everything in the article will apply to you or me, but it definitely made me think.

[Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting/videos), a fellow on YouTube who's done some really interesting videos on what makes good movies, good directing, good shots, and et cetera. I particularly enjoyed the Jackie Chan Action Comedy and the Edgar Wright Visual Comedy videos.

[Ai Weiwei is Living in Our Future](https://medium.com/@hansdezwart/ai-weiwei-is-living-in-our-future-474e5dd15e4f), an article about video surveillance and the changing of modern society, focused around having video available of everything, all the time. I won't lie, I skimmed part of the beginning, when they talk about Ai, but the rest of the article and the texts it cites are telling.

[The Taverns of Time](https://tavernsoftime.wordpress.com/), a well-made, fan-made, expansion pack for Hearthstone, if you're into that kind of thing.

[Colley Rankings](http://www.colleyrankings.com/), a system of ranking teams that takes into account *only* the wins, and the strength of the teams they've beaten, into the rankings. I was first drawn to it around the time of the College Football Playoff, and it appears there are Colley Rankings for NCAAB as well.

[A MICHIGAN FAN WATCHES OHIO STATE WIN THE NATIONAL TITLE](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/2015/1/14/7546957/a-michigan-fan-watches-ohio-state-win-the-national-title), a minor-parody, entirely-accurate state of emotion for the type of fan I am (despite rooting for Nebraska and not Michigan). These were my exact thoughts on OSU's win. [You remember.]({{ site.url }}/blog/college-football-playoffs)

[A Map that Recruiting Explains](http://www.teamspeedkills.com/2015/2/10/8013855/college-football-recruiting-map-explained), which is a map of football national champions. The best quote from the article: "Nebraska football's success is pretty much a miracle." The best quote from the comments: "Nebraska's success is not a miracle; It is just named Tom Osborne."

[learnfun and playfun: A Technique for Automating NES Games](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/mario/), a batch of magical software by the incredibly varied Tom7 that tries to optimize NES games based solely on making the numbers in the RAM increase.

Enjoy, I hope you found something you liked!
