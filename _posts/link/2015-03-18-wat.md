title: Wat, a lightning talk about Ruby and Javascript

[Wat.](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)

This talk is a few years old but *man* does it crack me up.

Gary Bernhardt talks for four minutes about a couple of tiny inconsistencies in Ruby, and a host of really silly things in Javascript, the best worst language that exists. Apparently he does a whole lot of serious talks too, but they're significantly longer (or pay-walled).

He does have another, almost-as-funny, lesson on (static and dynamic types)[https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/useing-youre-types-good], and if you liked the first, you'll also like this one.
