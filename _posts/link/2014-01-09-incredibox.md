With no introduction, you need to give [this website](http://www.incredibox.com) a try.

With an introduction: this website lets you drag and drop beats, sounds, melodies, and small voice parts, 7 at a time, into the window for cartoon beatboxers to sing for you. It's hypnotizing, well-put-together, includes a secret video, and has a shuffle mode you can just leave on (which I am).

Give it a shot. For background music, it almost can't be beat.

[Edit: I wrote this originally for Incredibox v3, and it's since been updated with a v4 (but it also won't allow loading if you use AdBlock, which is a pain in the neck).]
