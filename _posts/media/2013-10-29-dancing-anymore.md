I'm not even sure how I was linked to this, but this is a music video unlike any otherâ€”summing up both the near-future possibilities of virtual reality and, well, the disgusting mind of a boy.

This contains mostly-naked women (and some men too), and is certainly **not safe for work**. Enjoy at your own risk.

(Also worth checking out is the same band's video, [The Greeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwrbyVaC6EU), which contains much cartoon blood and explosions but is also interesting in its execution.)
