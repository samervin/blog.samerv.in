Three separate people told us that they saw us on TV. So I saved that little moment.

I wish the camera had caught any of many other moments. We were pretty jacked up for some other plays, this was tame.

If you have BTN2Go and a cable provider sign-in, you can watch the whole game [here](http://www.btn2go.com/game/michigan-st-at-nebraska-on-10072015). The moment below is right around the 69th minute.
