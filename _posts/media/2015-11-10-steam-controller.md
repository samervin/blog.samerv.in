title: An unboxing and first impressions of the Steam Controller
category: media

I'm not normally the type to buy things on a whim. I'm also not normally the type to preorder anything of any nature. Doesn't matter if it's movie tickets or video games or Kickstarter projects.

But I did both of those things and bought Valve's Steam Controller a couple months ago, and it came in the mail today. Here's some of my thoughts on the controller, its presentation, and how it compares to other inputs.

### Unboxing!

Here's the package as I found it laying on my doorstep. Pretty low-key.

Cut that open with a knife and you're presented with this pretty little gift-wrapped thing:

Slide the blue sleeve off and open the lid, and you get your first look at the shiny black plastic.

Lift up the controller and you're presented with the wireless dongle and the included AA batteries, which is a nice touch.

Lift up the foam piece and you get access to the guides (lame), charging cord, and mini-USB hub inside the little cardboard box in the back.

Here's all the pieces together (click for full image)! Thanks for sitting through my bad cell phone pictures!

### First impressions!

Plug it in, it downloads drivers and works. Steam prompted me to install a firmware update, which took seconds. I was super happy with how easy this was.

Before even jumping into a game, I played around with the buttons and the touchpads. Basic mouse control is useful and works well. You can scroll by drawing circles on the left touchpad. The mouse by default works like a trackball (you can flick it), and clicks like one too! It's really satisfying just to whip the cursor around.

Whenever you plug it in, or it does something important like installing firmware, it emits a cute little beep. It's a nice touch.

The ring finger buttons way on the back of the controller do feel a little awkward, even before getting into a game where they do something.

The Steam button in the middle always takes you to the active Steam window, whether it's normal or Big Picture mode. This is appropriate. I'll learn later that you generally want to be in Big Picture when you're using the controller.

More on that later. Let's play some games!

### Games!

I played an entire 40-minute game of Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth with the Steam controller. The game treats the Steam controller exactly like a 360 controller, and this does fine. The right touchpad feels too slow to use for tears, so I end up using the face buttons, which feel a little cramped. Dropping bombs and using items is easy, though, and I'm not really hampered by the input. This one was solid!

I played a couple quick rounds of Spelunky, a game that requires more precise reflexes than most of Binding of Isaac. Because the right joystick doesn't do anything in Spelunky, you simply move with the joystick and use the face buttons for your whip and items. Again, the face buttons feel a little cramped, and I accidentally drop more than one bomb. It's bearable, though.

Those games are easy, right? Built-in joystick support, 2D games. No strong worries. Let's crank it up a notch.

I boot up Skyrim and fiddle around for a bit. It's not bad. Skyrim has 360 controller support out of the box. All that's happened here is I've replaced a right thumbstick with a trackball. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The default sensitivity is low and so running around corners is awkward, but I don't blame the game for this. Skyrim is definitely possible to play here.

Next, I try Age of Empires II HD. Just for fun. I know someone from Valve showed off a prototype Steam controller by playing Civilization. How does a controller hold up to my favorite RTS?

Well, and I should have expected this: there's no built-in support for the controller. So I have a mouse pad and two buttons, and I've been sitting here a while. I don't play with it too much. For competitive Age of Empires, there's no question that the keyboard is superior. But, if playing casually, using the mouse is still possible.

### Configuration!

I didn't realize what I was missing here until I had stopped playing. Steam will prompt you if you try to play a game with no controller support from Big Picture mode. What you can do at this point is configure your controls (only in Big Picture) for that specific game.

Even if you don't want to think about it, the interface for just getting off the ground is slick. There's a spot for a developer-recommended config (sadly, Age of Empires doesn't have one yet), a list of all the published configs ranked by how many people are using them, and a place to play with your own personal configs.

There are _scads_ of options for customizing your controls. It's amazing how many subtleties in configuration exist.
- Each of the front pads (left pad, right pad, joystick, face buttons) can act as a mouse, a d-pad, four independent face buttons, a trackball, a joystick, or a scroll wheel. The controller can also emulate XInput for built-in compatibility with games.
- The two main triggers have a certain amount of pull before they click. You can assign completely different actions to "trigger depressed" and "trigger clicked". You can even customize how depressed the trigger has to be before it activates, how quickly you have to click it to bypass the depression action, and how the travel distance of the trigger scales relative to its physical position.
- All the other ordinary buttons (two shoulder, two back, two menu buttons) can output any key or combination of keys, which is invaluable and a great way to avoid game-level script configurations.

Oh, and this is all synced with your Steam profile. You no longer have to install dumb programs on your computer just to handle controller inputs.

### Comparisons and final tally

I'll be brief, because it's information you can already guess. Will this beat keyboard+mouse for sheer number of options or twitch reflexes? Absolutely not. Will this beat a 360 controller for every game with 360 support? Nope. But it does perform well in controller situations? Does it perform reasonably well in keyboard+mouse situations? You bet.

The longer the controller is out, the more worthwhile controller configurations will be created. The more worthwhile configurations are created, the easier it will be to play Steam games with a controller. This is pretty smart, and the ecosystem as a whole works well.

And besides, I got Rocket League for free with this thing. You can't tell me that's not worth it.
