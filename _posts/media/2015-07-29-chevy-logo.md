title: A brief complaint about steering wheel design

I drive a Chevrolet Cruze. The steering wheel and dashboard look roughly like this one in this picture, plus or minus a few options:

Fairly standard. Buttons for changing the radio station, horn, airbag, everything a car needs.

You'll notice the Chevy logo right in the middle there. That's fine, most steering wheels have logos on them. It makes sense. Show off the brand.

What doesn't make sense is the material the border is made out of. I've circled it in this picture:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/steering-wheel/logo-glare.jpg)

This part is some kind of metal. Some kind of reflective metal. On the steering wheel. Which you are facing nearly 100% of the time in a car.

I've been driving multiple times near sunset and the sun will catch the logo and direct beams of light directly into my eyeballs.

I wear sunglasses when I drive. I watch the road. I don't even drive excessively. And this bothers the _crap_ out of me.

Basically any time the sun is going down and I'm not going straight east or west, this will happen. And it's the most distracting part of a drive.

I feel like this should have been caught somewhere in testing.
