All of these are post-Goblins vs Gnomes expansion, which by the by is a buttload of fun and has changed the game so significantly that I'm excited for the future of Hearthstone.

First, a pack opening. I guess the game *really* wanted me to have those cards. The Ogre Brutes are some of my favorite new cards, to be fair.

Next, I finished a quest that I didn't even know existed, and got some sweet gold out of it.

And finally: I've been talking about saving up my dust for Sneed's Old Shredder for a while now. Why save up for one legendary when I can instead save up for a chance to see *all* of them, right? I was a long ways away, though, and so would most likely craft some epics and live without.

So I go to open a GvG pack, the second-to-last on the day, and I see the orange glow of a legendary. Sitting with my roommate next to me, I called out, "Oh my God it's Sneed's Old Shredder. Then I don't have to save up for him."

I flipped the other four cards first, and look what I got.

Hell yes.
