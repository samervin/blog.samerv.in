title: Things my dad has said

I've been hanging on to certain emails from my dad for quite a while now. We occasionally shoot emails back and forth -- I'll link him to an article, he'll comment on it, and sometimes we get into some heady discussions about sports and sport players.

Here's some choice quotes. I've cut out some stuff in the interests of brevity, but all the words attributed to him are his own.

When Bo Pelini, former Nebraska football head coach, was fired, he was recorded [ranting to players](http://www.omaha.com/huskers/bo-pelini-insults-a-d-shawn-eichorst-in-expletive-filled/article_b202b14a-8633-11e4-8c91-f3f5386da4f8.html), mostly about Shawn Eichorst but also about "the administration". Despite being a general fan of Bo Pelini, and always a fan of the Huskers no matter the helmsman, this news was difficult to form an opinion on.

I sent that link to my dad, tagged just with "I have lots of mixed feelings." Here's his response:

> I kind of do, too. Pelini defended his players and felt like he didn't have to defend himself. He can say what he wants about never talking to Eichorst, but Bo knew where his office is. I don't like Bo going out like this and I suspect a disgruntled player recorded it and leaked it.

> This will make it easier for some people to let Bo go and probably say "I told you so."  I also think Bo could have taken the high road and said "It didn't work out."  But that ain't Bo. I admire him for being himself, even if it is for nothing good.

The next day, I sent him the link to [the official response letter](https://twitter.com/bigtennetwork/status/545350484295315456), which kind of irked me. I really just wanted everything to smooth over, for everyone's sake. Here's the response:

> The high road.  NU should have taken it.  There are times when someone is trolling you or trying to provoke you where the best response you can make is none at all.  Someone asked Morgan Freeman about racism and he said we should stop talking about it.  If you stop talking about it and paying attention to it, it’ll go away.  But if you keep feeding the monster, it gets stronger.

> I get why Bo’s bent.  I liked a lot of things about Bo.  Did I like his sideline demeanor?  No.  If you go back in time to Devaney, not everybody was in love with him.  He liked whiskey (what Irishman doesn’t), he liked cigars and dancing.  He yelled at people, swore at players.  But he loved them and supported them and tried to make them good men.  I think the same is true of Bo.  The difference is that Bo was hired with higher expectations and the media was in his face about his job security all the time.  There wasn’t a camera pointed at Bob Devaney after every missed tackle.

> It is my sincerest hope that this is the last word on Bo Pelini in regards to his tenure at Nebraska.  I rooted for him as the coach of my favorite college football team.  I rooted for Frank Solich, but they fired him, too.

When Ohio State won the first CFB National Championship, I was pretty disappointed. I was hoping for Oregon to beat Alabama in the final, because there was no doubt in my mind at that point those two teams were the best in the sport. That, and I think TCU got hosed. I wrote about this in [this blog post](blog/college-football-playoffs) if you want to read more.

Anyway. My feelings got summed up in a funny way over on SBNation in this article, titled [A MICHIGAN FAN WATCHES OHIO STATE WIN THE NATIONAL TITLE](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/2015/1/14/7546957/a-michigan-fan-watches-ohio-state-win-the-national-title). I sent this off to my dad, who replied:

> I feel the same way.  I used to kind of like Michigan football.  The cool helmets, the black shoes, the all-blue uniforms.  Then I stopped caring.  But I still didn’t like Ohio State.  Bunch of cocky fuckers.  Hated Jim Tressel.  Arrogant, self-absorbed SOB that got his team banned, but got off scot-free.  Now Urban Meyer.  Cocky, self-absorbed (like he knows there’s a camera on him at all times).  Didn’t like him at Utah or Florida, either.  Some people you just don’t like.  Period.

> I used to feel the same way about Oklahoma, but I pine for the old real rivalries.  Not Iowa.  Fuck Iowa.  What a phony, trumped-up rivalry.  Colorado at one time declared Nebraska their rival, the Huskers had none of it.  Colorado was business, Oklahoma was a rival.  That being said, I will not root for Texas, either.  I know Charlie Strong is the coach now and what’s-his-name is gone (but still invading my home on TV) but still I hate Texas.

> Teams I hate:

> - The Fucking Dallas Cowboys
> - The New Fucking York Yankees
> - The Fucking Texas Longhorns
> - The Ohio Fucking State Buckeyes
> - The Fucking Boston Bruins

> I think that covers it.  For now.  I wanted Oregon to win.  I wanted Scott Frost to jump on the field and pound Ezekiel Elliot into a pulp.  To be fair, Scott Frost the player would have levelled Cardale Jones on the corner and called the morgue.  No doctor would save him and the cause of death would be obvious.  Other than that, I just hate Ohio State.  Think they’re the only team in Ohio (maybe they are).

> Have you ever seen the LeGarrette Blount episode?  Blount was a bruiser of a back for Oregon that got a little riled up at the end of a loss and flat knocked a player from the other team out. Guy from Boise ran his mouth in Blount’s face and got cold-cocked.  Scott Frost, twelve years removed from football, grabbed Blount and wrestled him out of the picture before he got killed.  At about the 35-second mark [[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEu3GzNDs74)], Frost is the blond guy pulling a 245-pound guy to the tunnel.

> Whew.  There it is.  Any questions?

This particular incident didn't line up with anything in particular, I just liked [this article](http://www.royalsreview.com/2015/1/15/7548175/breaking-espn-learns-there-are-30-teams-in-major-league-baseball) revealing that there are, in fact, more than 9 teams in baseball. (Read the green comments for a bit more hilarity.) Here's my dad's reply:

> To be fair, I’m glad the Cards are on pretty regularly.  Because they don’t have an affiliate here, we just don’t get them on the scale that I’d like.  ESPN has a strong east coast bias.  I get so sick of seeing the New Fucking York Yankees and the Boston Fucking Red Sox.  Even last year when NY was an also-ran, still twice a week.  Same with Boston three years ago.  I don’t like it that the Cubs are on ever, unless they’re getting pasted by the Cardinals.  They have a fan base that is so used to losing, they are not relevant.  But, they have their own network.  Occasionally, the White Sox appear on said network and there is an uproar.  Same with Atlanta, although the Braves usually put a pretty good product on the field.   I was watching Cubs-Braves a few years ago (because that was the only thing on TV) and it was on both WGN and TBS.  I watched it on TBS because the announcers were calling that game, not lamenting how bad the team’s luck was this year.

> The Pangaea Division should be a real thing.  NY and Boston in one division and everyone else in Pangaea.  I actually think it’s pretty lame that the Royals are on as much as they are.  For most of the last three decades, they have been insignificant.  I only really care because they usually have the Tigers’ games on.  Incidentally, WGN got moved to a higher tier of cable programming, off of the lowest tier.  I don’t know if that’s an effort to raise money through higher fees on greater offerings that no one watches or a movement by Cox to get those clowns off TV.

> I have long contended that every team should be on Sunday Night Baseball at least once per season.  Monday Night Football has every team on at least once.  ESPN, however, only shows baseball teams that have a good following.  Even if they suck.

> In conclusion, and not a moment too soon, this was fun to read.  The comment attributed to Curt Schilling was pretty funny.  Curt has some good insights, but is a vocal right-winger that really needs to know his place.  I wonder if ESPN will read this and say, “WTF?  Perhaps we should step back and take a look at our programming slate.”

> “Nah, we’re good.”

Thanks, Dad, for your great words.
