title: Another entirely different trip to Detroit!
category: blog

So, about [two years ago]({{ site.url }}/blog/trip-to-detroit) my family and I went to Detroit to see the Tigers play.

This year, for spring break, we decided to drive up and see a Red Wings game. The Red Wings are building a new arena, don't you know, and we wanted to see the Joe Louis Arena before they knock it down.

So we drove up, two Fridays ago. It's about an eleven-hour drive. I can't say that the drive was *fun* but it was fine, all things considered. Plenty of fast food. I've now set foot in Indiana, notably.

Stayed in a hotel in one of the suburbs and slept. Driving in a car all day is exhausting.

Woke up early Saturday to drive downtown and do a little shopping before the 2 o'clock game. I got a pretty cool [knit hat](http://www.detroitathletic.com/detroit-red-wings-ladies-the-jess-knit-hat.html) on the cheaps from a place called Detroit Athletic Co., which I promptly didn't take off for the rest of the day. (Also: totally not just a ladies' hat.)

After some more walking around, we found our way to the Hockeytown Cafe, a big two-story Red Wings sports bar, with some pretty good food (try the barbecue mac and cheese). There was a free shuttle from the Cafe to the Joe, so we parked for much cheaper and rode the shuttle to the arena.

We spent a long time walking around the concourse. There are three larger-than-life bronze statues around the front end: Alex Delvecchio, Ted Lindsay, and Gordie Howe. I tried (and failed) to get a decent picture of Gordie Howe, so I'll link you to a better picture [here](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3145/2612513530_38723f82c6_b.jpg). It's not quite the same color anymore, but the statue is seriously impressive.

Headed up to our seats plenty early to watch warm-ups and take in the ambiance of the place. Below is the view from our seats. I couldn't read all of the banners, but they're full of retired jerseys, Stanley Cups, and other team accomplishments.

The Red Wings ended up *smashing* the Tampa Bay Lightning, 4-0, which is doubly important because the Lightning are ahead of Detroit in the playoff race. Big goals, big yelling, and lots of singing along to songs like "Don't Stop Believin'" from the home crowd, which was a lot of fun.

We headed back to our car, tried to get dinner at Slow's, didn't want to wait around for 90 minutes, so we ate at the Mercury just across the street, and headed back to the hotel to watch the UNO hockey team on TV.

I fell asleep in the middle of the game, but the Mavericks won, which was not only a sweet playoff win, but their *first* playoff win, *ever*. Super exciting time for them.

Come Sunday, we piled our stuff into the car and drove the 11 hours back. I slept significantly more on the way back. We made it home in time to watch the Mavs win *another* postseason game and make it to the Frozen Four, setting more records for UNO.

What a weekend.

Couple extra notes:

We drove by a sign on a building that said "Hotel Yorba". I tried my best to take a picture of it; after all, I'd heard [the White Stripes song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZPEUyiNcjA), and I was curious if there was a story behind it. Lo and behold, Wikipedia came through for me ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Yorba)). Turns out, the White Stripes are *from* Detroit, that is *the* Hotel Yorba, and apparently it's government housing now. Go figure.

We also drove by a sign for Telegraph Road, which is the name of [a Dire Straits song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd3btVhwr48). Tee up, Google, where is Mark Knopfler from?

Well, he's from the UK, *but* this song was written about that exact street, while he was on a bus in Detroit. (Thanks, [Wikipedia again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_Road_%28song%29).)

Thought it was interesting to notice two music-related things in the same trip, but there you go!
