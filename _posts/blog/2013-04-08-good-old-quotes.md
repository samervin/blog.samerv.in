Most of these are meant to be funny, some are meant to be serious, all were worth writing down.

From the Culver's kitchen:
>Zach: Praise baby Jesus!

>Me: ... why baby Jesus?

>Zach: Because he was the cutest of all the Jesus-es.

From somewhere in Tumblr (though surely not originally):
>An infinite number of mathematicians walks into a bar. The first goes up to the bartender and says, “I’ll have a pint of lager, please.” Each next one says, “and I’ll have half of what he’s having.” The bartender says, “You’re all idiots,” and pulls two pints.

From Russ:
>‎It violates mathematics, but we’re engineers, we don’t care.

From Tony Kornheiser:
>My favorite president was Warren G. Harding, because the G stood for Gangster!

From Aaron:
>A Cardinals fan, a Cubs fan, and a Red Sox fan are all climbing up the side of the mountain arguing about who loves their team more. The Red Sox fan yells, “This is for Boston!” and jumps off the side of the mountain. Not to be outdone, the Cardinals fan yells, “This is for St Louis!” and pushes the Cubs fan off the mountain.

From my own stupid mouth:
>My toes are freezing! I wish I had some sort of… toe-gloves.

>...

From Lord of War:

>How do we arm the other 11?

From Chuck Palahniuk's "Survivor":
>Long-term, we’re all going to die. Then our bodies will rot. No surprise there. Short-term, we’re all going to live happily ever after. Really. So don’t sweat it. You can just relax and let things happen. Disasters, like pain, and misery. And Joy, and Serenity, and Happiness, and Contentment. You don’t have to control everything. You can’t control everything. If you worry about disaster all the time, that’s what you’re going to get. I want you to know I won’t always be here, but I’ll always find you. No matter what happens, no matter what you do, it’s the right thing. You just have to trust me.

> - Would the world have been different if Einstein had owned a hairbrush?

> - If you smell an odorless gas, leave the room immediately.

From John Kingdon's "America The Unusual":

>Whether the majority is right or informed doesn’t matter; it’s the majority.

From Skocpol and Williams' "The Tea Party and the Remaking of American Conservatism":

From Adam Gopnik's "Decline, Fall, Rinse, Repeat":

>Annoying liberals is a pleasure worth paying for.

From Kazzymodus, a poster on Facepunch:

From Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:
