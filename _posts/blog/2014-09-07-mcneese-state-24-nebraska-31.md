What an... interesting game, with a great finish. Couple notes:

The band played Everything is Awesome, the song from the Lego Movie, during the 3rd quarter. That was neat.

Westerkamp had another crazy one-handed catch, and he laid himself out for a third but that one got called back on a penalty. I think Westercatch should be a real nickname now. As long as he never returns punts.

My dad texted me, "AMEER FOR PRESIDENT!!" directly after the end of the game, and it made me laugh a lot.
