title: How to be an effective soccer goaltender
category: blog
---

When I played soccer as a child, I was a goalie, and a darn good one. I kept at it in high school and [didn't have as much success]({{ site.url }}/blog/soccer-goalie-and-hardware-architect).

My brother is now right around the age I was when I was in my goaltending prime. I unfortunately don't have a lot of time to dedicate to helping him improve. My dad, who is helping coach his team, asked that I write down any advice I had. I compiled quite a bit of information and sent it off to him, and realized I had a decent crop of advice ready to be shared.

I owe almost all of my goalkeeper knowledge to Martin Mwita, who coached my select soccer team to the championships and helped me one-on-one more than any other coach or teacher I've ever had. I'm not sure where he's at now, but I hope he's coaching soccer to young goalies like me.

Anyway, here's the advice. There's a lot of information here. It is written at the goalkeeper himself; whether this is you the goalie reading it or you the coach repeating it to your players, it still holds. It is further written in the male perspective because it was originally intended for my brother's team; use whatever pronouns you feel comfortable with.

### THINGS YOU SHOULD BE SAYING

- TURN or TIME. When your defender receives a ball and there is no offender nearby, let him know so he can line up a stronger kick or pass.
- MAN ON. If your defender is handling a ball and a man is coming from behind him, let him know so he may protect the ball and make an informed play.
- PUSH UP. This depends on your team and your defensive alignment. If one of your defenders is lagging behind the rest (affecting the offsides call), or if you want the entire defense to push up and create more pressure on the opponent, say so. Don't overuse this, and try to work with your coach so you're not contradicting him.
- OUT or AWAY. If the situation is dire and you need the ball as far away from the goal quickly, say so. Your defender may make a safe play to the outside of the field or he may kick the ball out of bounds to stall. Do not hesitate to call for this if your defense is outnumbered.
- __KEEPER or GOALIE or MINE or I GOT IT.__ Tell your defenders that you are going to handle the ball. They should block any offenders from getting to the ball before you. This call is __extremely critical.__ You should __always yell keeper__ no matter the situation. Depending on the age group, you may even scare an offender from the ball just by being confident and calling for the ball.

### THINGS TO DO ONCE YOU HAVE THE BALL

- __WAIT AND LOOK.__ This is the toughest thing for a new goalie. Receiving the ball on the end line means that your defense is probably in the penalty box, and your midfielders are on your side of the field, and your forwards may have marked up. Move deliberately to the end of the penalty box and allow your players to position themselves for a kick or throw.
- SWTICH SIDES. If you received the ball on one side of the field, chances are the majority of both teams are on that same side of the field. If you switch sides, and your forwards do the same, you have more opportunities for kicking to an open player.
- __LEAD PLAYERS and KICK DOWN LINES.__ At younger ages, you want to kick the ball past your offenders so they can run with the ball and handle it as it lands. At older ages, you may want to be more particular with how players receive it. Also, you usually want to kick to the edges of the field, as the middle is often more crowded and more contested, leading to a lesser probability of your team controlling the kick.

### THINGS TO REMEMBER TO DO

- __CUT OFF ANGLES.__ Always position yourself so that the offender has a roughly equal shot on both sides of you. This means that no matter what shot he takes, he will be at a disadvantage. Remember, you don't want to get too far to the left or right of the goal if the ball is in the corner of the field.
- __KEEP YOUR BODY BETWEEN THE GOAL AND THE BALL.__ I'm not going to get into specifics here. There are positions you should take when the ball is rolling on the ground, when the ball is stopped in place, when the ball is below your chest, and when the ball is above your head. In short, keep as much of your body behind the ball as possible, so that a mishandled ball will not immediately result in a goal.
- ALWAYS FACE THE BALL. During normal movement, don't turn your body sideways. You should be perpendicular to the offender and the ball. This allows you to move side to side and be ready for any shot.
- HANDS:
    - When the ball is above your chest, make a diamond or triangle with your fingers. Catch the ball with as many fingers as possible. Keep your body behind your hands.
    - When the ball is below your chest, make a W with your pinkies. Catch the ball with all your fingers. Shuffle to keep your legs behind your hands.
    - Scoop every ball into your chest. The ball is not secure until you have done so. Control every ball before any further steps.
- NEVER SIT ON THE GOAL LINE. If the ball is in your end of the field, you should be shuffling to a better position and following the ball, ready to make a move. If the ball is in the opposite end of the field, you can push up towards (and out of) the penalty box. Either way, the only two reasons to be on the end line are corner kicks and penalty kicks.
- __ALWAYS MEET THE BALL.__ Never wait for the ball to roll to you. This is doubly important near the goal. Sprinting isn't necessary, but haste is. If you mishandle the ball or an offender gets to it first, you need to maximize your chances of recovering. Remember to yell _KEEPER_ first.
- __STAY ON YOUR FEET AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.__ This is very situational; there is no formula for when to leave your feet. Any action that grants you the ball or blocks a shot supersedes this, obviously. You want to remain upright as long as possible before this happens so that you are ready to react to the offender's movement.

### PRE-GAME WARMUP ROUTINE

These drills are generally designed for a pair of goalies (as that's what I did in high school). Pairing a coach with a goalie works as well.

- Sit up drill. Sit on your butt a few feet away from your partner. Throw the ball over your head to your partner, similar to a throw-in. When your partner catches it, have him roll onto his back (like a sit-up) and throw the ball back. The ball should be easy to handle, but not always in the same spot over the head. Adjust distance until you have a good rhythm.
- __Knee drill.__ Stand on your knees several yards across from your partner. Take turns throwing it back and forth to each other. All balls should be handled with the correct finger placement. Curl every ball into your chest. Start relatively slowly, but ramp up and throw the ball anywhere within your partner's reach.
- High throws. Throw the ball high above your partner's head. Remember, you should catch high balls by jumping and catching the ball at the apex of your jump. Remember also to bring a knee up to protect yourself. You don't need to do a lot of these, but they'll get your blood pumping.
- Dives. The number and quality of the dives you practice depends on your age and skill level. Have your partner stand on the endline and throw or kick the ball to either side of him. Ideally, he will dive and meet the ball right as he dives for it. The side you kick to should be random.
- __Take shots.__ The PK line is a good starting point. The object is not to score goals on your partner; the object is to warm your partner up to real kicks. Kick it hard, but not as hard as you can. Aim for him and to every side of him: left, right, high, and low. Remember, curl every ball into your chest before you roll it back. Do as many of these as you need. If you need to back up, do so.
- Practice kicking. This can be done during any downtime. Practice punting and goal kicks. If you can use the net, do so. If you can't, line up on the sidelines and kick it to your partner. Accuracy is more important than power for warming up.
- Take shots from outside the penalty box. You don't need to paint the corners on every shot, but you should be shooting hard. It will be significantly more helpful to your partner to shoot it hard directly at him than it will be to loft it into the corner. Switch up your shots and make him handle as many types of shot as you can take.
    - If you have the time and the space, have the offense do a passing or crossing drill. Any drill that forces you to switch sides and changes the shooter will help you. You will benefit more if you don't know where the shot will come from.
    - Don't continue to receive shots if you're tired or frustrated. Don't allow your partner to do this either. Switch goalies or simply take a break. Don't stress yourself out too much before a game.

### CLOSING THOUGHTS AND LESSONS

- BE DECISIVE. Remember, if you yell __I GOT IT__ then _you must absolutely try and get it._ If you don't, then your teammates won't trust you, and you won't trust yourself. If the ball is kicked away before you could handle it, consider yelling _KEEPER_ earlier. Don't fret over this too much. Learn your defenders and what plays they can make.
- __ALWAYS TRY TO BLOCK A SHOT.__ This is primarily a mental booster. If you attempt to block every shot, even the shots you're convinced you'll never catch up to, your teammates will trust you more. They'll see that you never give up on a ball and take note of that. Also, some of the shots you think are out of reach _aren't_, and you'll make more saves.
- __HAVE A BAD MEMORY.__ Make sure you understand this. Make sure all the goalkeepers on your team understand this. If you or your defense make a mistake and let a goal in, you have to forget about it immediately and focus on the game ahead. Remember: __zero percent of the goals scored on you will be entirely your fault. Zero percent of the goals scored on you will make it impossible for your team to come back and win the game.__
- There is a lot of pride in being a goalkeeper. Take that to heart, but don't let it ruin you. You're the field general. You're in charge of the defense, and the team, all of the time. Own it.
