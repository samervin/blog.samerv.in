*Ender's Game* is, I think, my favorite book. I'm wary to call it that, but it's top three material for sure. If you've never read it, or if you've never seen the movie, Ender's Game is the story of a brilliant kid (and other slightly-less-brilliant kids) in the near-future who are called into military service to stop an alien threat.

There are three sequels to Ender's Game that comprise a trilogy in themselves, they're a bit different in setting and tone than the original (these are *Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide,* and *Children of the Mind*).

There is also a companion novel to Ender's Game, *Ender's Shadow,* which takes place mainly during the same time period as Ender's Game from the view of a different character. The extended Shadow series (four more books) follows that alternate character.

More than that, I'm not really at liberty to say. I haven't even seen the movie, because the movie is never as good as the book. But the rest of this post is going to talk, in generalities and specifics, about the four Ender books. (The Shadow series will be separate). So put your spoiler hats on, and **don't read below the fold if you don't want to be spoiled.**

So let's talk about the main Ender series for a bit.

The original book is still, in my mind, the pinnacle of the Enderverse, and I think this is a common opinion. (I almost said the pinnacle of Orson Scott Card, but to be fair I haven't read anything of his outside the Ender series.)

I first read it when I was in middle school, if I remember right, and I've since reread it five or six times or so. It's well-written, it's believable, it's triumphant, it's heartbreaking. Class A. Ten out of ten. I don't have a lot to say about it that hasn't already been said, or that you can't think up when you read it yourself (and you really ought to).

Let's push on to the sequels, then. The thousands-of-years-in-the-future sequels. (I told you there would be spoilers!) I got partway through *Children* back in middle school, but wasn't interested and quit halfway through (and I'll talk about why). I read them again just this past year or so and have more thoughts about them.

*Speaker*, the immediate sequel, is nearly as well-written as the original, but it represents a huge shift in toning and theming from the original. (It's the only other one to win the Hugo award, if I remember correctly).

Basically, Speaker is entirely *not* a series of games, like the original book. Instead, it's a much more raw book of discovery and slow realization. There are more politics and larger fields of thought involved. It's not a children's "war" novel. It's significantly more tailored to thinking and processing.

This isn't bad, on its own. I liked *Speaker* a lot. It sets up the piggies, it continues the story of Ender in a curious (thousands of years??) but satisfying (secret author and Speaker??) way. The piggies are murdererers (but they aren't), the colony is officially revolting, there's a horrible descolada virus slowly killing everyone, these are all great events that are happening.

The conflicts between the Hive Queen and the piggies and the humans, and the conflicts between the established Catholocism and the Speakings are interesting. And they lead nicely into the sequel.

*Xenocide*, or at least the bulk of the book, is just as good as *Speaker*. Same sorts of themes. Same sorts of story. Before the climax (which I'll get to!), the story of Jane is probably the weakest point.

And don't get me wrong, I like Jane! I like her weird presence with Ender, I like her sympathies with Miro, I like her interactions overall. Her existence is the weakest part, despite being explained in-universe -- but this is also a source of conflict, since she's in danger of being killed (as killed as a sentient computer program can be).

Most everything else leading up to the climax is done well too, in my opinion. The piggies and humans are communicating, Starways Congress is threatening to detonate the planet, the Hive Queen's intense desire to spread and colonize... it's all well done.

Even the alternate storyline, of Path and their ancient rituals (aka OCD), integrate with the story nicely. In fact (I had to double-check this), it's Qing-jao that initiates the plot to kill Jane. I like the progression that this story takes. It's a bit out-of-the-blue as the characters are introduced, but it works pretty well.

Then the climax happens. Jane can think *really hard* and pop anything at all into an alternate, not-a-dimension. Okay. Stretching credibility here. Also, every human aboard the ship can keep track of *themselves* during the trip Outside, too. *Okay.*

Oh, and Ender is so influenced by his siblings, he manages to create *two extra copies* of them, a new-Peter and a new-Valentine. Of *course.*

At this point in the book, you know, it's cool, really, it's okay! This is a *huuuge* leap for me, and I'm all about minimizing mental leaps in stories. But I can, sort of, roll with it. We need it for the recolada, which will solve all the viral problems of Lusitania, and we also get the cure to the OCD on Path. Like, these are important, even if the whole thing is a bit deus ex machina.

The fourth book I honestly don't remember incredibly well. I had to confirm parts of the plot by skimming the book and looking online. That by itself should tell you something about the book.

What I do remember is that it got kind of preachy and overly religious, and even the weird rules about traveling in and out of Outside aren't the hardest-to-believe parts of the story anymore. What's harder to believe is that the not-people -- the extra Peter and Valentine we made in the last book? -- that's where Ender (when he dies) and Jane (when she dies) end up, because they believed in their auras hard enough. This has *never been done before* but it was good enough to work perfectly, twice, for two completely different sorts of people.

I know that that's the point of the auras (actually ai√∫as). But if Outside was a single deus ex machina, this is a whole *pantheon* in the machine. Jane then links with the piggie father trees (oh duh) and teleports the M.D. Device Outside so it can be disarmed and everyone is saved. Woooo.

Back from spoilertown. It comes down to this, ultimately:

- If you want a book like *Ender's Game*, disregard the Ender series, you should read *Ender's Shadow*. Almost as good, interesting for both fans of the original and people who have never read the original, and with much the same themes (though layered a little differently, particularly towards the end). And the continued Shadow series is much closer in style to the original.

- If you want to learn more about Ender, casually, you should give *Speaker for the Dead* a try. You might like it, and if it's too slow-paced or just isn't your cup of tea, you can comfortably stop and you won't be left in too big of a mental hole.

- If you have more than a casual interest in Ender, and/or you enjoyed *Speaker*, you should read *Xenocide*. If, upon reading the ending of Xenocide, you find you hate the direction it turned? Stop there. It doesn't get better.

- If you gotta know what happens to everybody, well, you gotta read the whole series, but I'd bet you won't enjoy it wholeheartedly, especially if you were a huge fan of the original book. That's the way the cookie crumbles.
