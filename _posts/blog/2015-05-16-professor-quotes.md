title: Quotes from my professors

So this past spring semester, I only had two classes that I attended in person.

One of them was a computer networks class, basically a "how does the internet work" class. The other was a statistics class.

I didn't pay as much attention as I should have in networks, and I didn't learn as much as I ought to have in statistics, but they were still valuable classes.

Both professors (well, one professor and one grad student) said some funny things in the course of teaching, and I'm sharing the ones I remembered to write down.

First, from networks:

- "The network is propogating my bits!"

- [on wireless networks] "He cannot do him a solid because the solid is not there!"

- [on diagram perspective] "Me router."

- [on being close enough] "We are engineers, we are more or less people."

- "There are many butts."

Also, inspired by a real markerboard drawing he put on the board, I present the Server-to-Client File Distribution Monster. The server is his head, and the clients are his feet.

Next, stats. The grad student teaching this class was pretty funny.

- [on some silly data] "Redonkulous!"

- "If your variance is 0, you don't need statistics. You need a ruler."

- [on this being his last semester] "You can't spit in my cocktail!"

- "If the p [value] is low, reject the H0 [null hypothesis]."

- [on what statisticians should be doing] "Question. Everything."

- [on what statisticians should keep doing] "Keep questioning!"

- [while teaching regression analysis] "I will make you *dangerous!*"

- [on NBA team data] "Payroll is measured in millions of dollars, wins are measured in blood, sweat, and tears."

- [on canceling infinities] "This is why we don't get along with the math department -- we're cavalier about our infinities."

- [on the linear predictor] "We put it into a bag. We bagged the sucker."

- [on the logit function] "If you write it like this, son, you get the odds. Don't question."

- [on using stats as an icebreaker] "Swipe left on *that!*"
