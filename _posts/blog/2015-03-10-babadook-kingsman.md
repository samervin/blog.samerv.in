In the last few weeks, I saw both The Babadook and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I loved them both, for very different reasons! Read the top part of the article if you want a broad overview of the movies, with some general impressions, but **don't go below the divider** without having seen the movies, please! I talk about a couple major **spoilers** and you really ought to see both of these movies.

*The Babadook* is a horror film first and foremost, but what's crucial to this movie is *how* it goes about its horror. This is not a cheap jump-scare movie. The bad guy is almost never waiting around the corner, behind the door, or under the bed, and if he is, you know he's there well before you could be *surprised* by his presences. In fact, there's really only one or two moments in the entire movie where something takes you by surprise, and it isn't the bad guy.

No, what's excellent about this movie is the actual, psychological, *thinking* horror that drives it forward. The progression of the story, and the changes that occur to the main characters over such a relatively short period of time, are gripping and interesting. The entire movie is *intense* -- I had my legs pressed up against my seat for basically the entire movie, from near the beginning until well past the climax, fearful of one final twist.

The sound direction is, in my unprofessional opinion, the best nonobvious element of the movie. Dramatic moments are hinted at by strong musical tones, but often times we (the audience) are left with raw silence during emotional moments, whether good or bad, and it strengthens the performance by the actors, in particular Essie Davis (the mother).

So, Babadook is really well done. It doesn't pull any punches and doesn't slow down. There's no cheap shots. Every scene is important. There aren't any excessively gross scenes (barring a couple of isolated parts, which were fine even for someone as squeamish as me). Well worth a watch.

*Kingsman* is a spy movie that makes fun of spy movies. It's pretty decked out with stars, including Colin Firth, Sam Jackson, Michael Caine, and an appearance by Mark Hamill. There's lots of action. There are lots of one-liners. It's really funny.

I have less general words to say about Kingsman, because I knew slightly more about it going in, and because there is just less I can say without spoiling anything serious. Listen. There's some over-the-top violence. This is sort of to-be-expected. It made me squirm a bit, but it is done well, I think, and lends to the over-the-top tone of it all.

There are a handful of subtle (and *overt*) references to spy movies, specifically Bond movies, sprinkled in throughout the movie. The plot, and the subtle twist on the plot, are *exactly* serious enough that you care what happens, but also *exactly* tongue-in-cheek enough that you're willing to let certain things go.

The soundtrack is really well done. The score is good, yes, there are fine backing tunes, but I really loved the rock music chosen, particularly in the intro and near the climax. There are lots of scattered pop culture references in addition to the spy movie homages thrown in, which come off as high fives and not cheap tie-ins. Look, Kingsman is really good. Not for your children, or your little brothers, but it's a hell of a lot of fun.

Okay, now for the **spoiler-y** stuff. Seriously, don't read on unless you've seen the movies, particularly Kingsman.

It is interesting that, in the Babadook, we get to see the monster. There is not a lot of revealing drama. It darts across the ceiling, and always takes roughly the same form (when it isn't taking the form of the dead husband). But it still manages to be *creepy* and fully unnerving, every time it's on screen.

As I was watching this movie, I took it almost entirely at face value. What I mean by that is, I watched it as though the Babadook was actually a spooky black spectre, and the two main characters were fighting its influence. There are plenty of other interpretations, though, varying from the generic "monster = grief" to the more specific, like the Babadook directly representing drug addiction (as prefaced by the mother being particularly happy when the doctor prescribes her son strong medication). Certainly, it's a metaphor for something, but it works just as well if it *isn't*, which I think makes the movie even stronger.

The fully creepiest scene in the movie is definitely the sequence where the mother snaps the dog's neck and rips out her own tooth, back to back. Sure, we kind of saw *something* happening with the dog, but the tooth part? That was hard to stomach.

And, of course, the ending, which left me mostly speechless. Just feed the mythical monster worms, okay, great, sure. I understand this is a metaphor. Everything is a metaphor. But man, is it a weird way to end it. Not a feel-good ending at all. I'm 100% okay with that in the context of making a good horror film, don't get me wrong! It's really well-done! It just took me by surprise.

Okay, now Kingsman. Can we talk, briefly, about the scene in the church? Bear in mind, first, that that's an *uninterrupted* take. (Confirmed [here](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/13/kingsman-director-matthew-vaughn-reveals-secrets-behind-church-scene-sex-joke-and).) Also, bear in mind that, in-universe, it's completely unprovoked.

At first, when my friends and I saw that scene, one of us thought it was part of a dream sequence at first. The justification isn't clear until after the fight, of course, and you don't have time to think about it, you're too busy watching Colin Firth go *fucking nuts* on everybody in the room. Playing Free Bird in the background is, in my mind, a *masterstroke*, and not overdone at all -- it's the perfect combination of southern-church-going roots and kick-ass rock-and-roll anarchy.

Then he walks outside, thoroughly confused, and is promptly shot by the ultra-squeamish lisped Sam Jackson. Flawed villains. Flawed, *funny* villains, that simultaneously prop up and break down the stereotypes of their genre.

Hell, they *explicitly* allude to this! When Firth and Jackson meet, they talk specifically about James Bond, and old spy movies, and *their own characters!* This is so good!

Okay. Enough yelling. Couple more quick things. When Eggsy's mother is knifing the door to get in at her child, it reminded me strongly of, what else, the Babadook. That part is probably the most unsettling part in the entire movie, or at least it was to me. It's the most real, despite not being her real emotions. And maybe that's what's so freaky about it.

Heads exploding like soda bottles? Hilarious. Completely takes the sting off of popping the President's head. Eggsy getting rewarded with "sex in the asshole" by the princess in the jail cell? Hilarious. Completely grounds the movie in what I think it's really meant to be -- a big fat spy joke, but done well.
