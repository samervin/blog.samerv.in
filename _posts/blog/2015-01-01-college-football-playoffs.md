title: The very first College Football Playoffs
---

![]({{site.url}}/images/cfb-playoff.png)

On this, the first of January, the first College Football Playoffs happened. Two big bowl games, along with three other slightly less big bowl games, happened. I have strange opinions on a couple, I guess! Here's where I'm at. I'll go in order, with CFB rankings noted.

**18-Wisconsin defeats 19-Auburn, 34-31.**

I've been saying essentially since this matchup was announced that I was interested in how this game would turn out. I definitely thought that Auburn would win the game; I think most people thought the same. But I was curious how Auburn would handle Melvin Gordon, and how hungry Wisconsin would be after getting flattened in the Big Ten championship game.

And as it turned out, they didn't handle them quite enough, and Wisconsin managed to take it to overtime on a field goal, winning with a field goal in overtime (over the missed FG from Auburn). This is a big deal, and I'm happy for Wisconsin.

**8-Michigan State defeats 5-Baylor, 42-42.**

Michigan State pulled off a huge fourth quarter 20-point comeback to beat the Bears. This is also, in general, good for the Big Ten and thus I am, in general, in favor of this.

What I also like about this is I think it makes a stronger case for leaving Baylor out of the playoff picture. I prefer my top four teams to be clearly defined. Despite beating TCU, and feeling like the best team in the Big 12, I didn't think they were top 4 material (neither did the committee), and this game showed it, even if only slightly.

**16-Missouri defeats 25-Minnesota, 33-17.**

I had a lot less interest in this game. I figured Mizzou would win, and they did. Minnesota has some good players and has had some good games, but I don't think they had a huge chance against a team that played tougher competition (even if they did lose to... Indiana??). Big Ten can't win 'em all. Moving on.

**2-Oregon defeats 3-Florida State, 59-20.**

I tried watching this game. The online ESPN player went down shortly into the first quarter and was down -- for everyone! -- until halftime or so, and even then it was spotty and prone to dying. I played a lot of Smash Bros. while I was waiting.

I did, and do still, want Oregon to win the national championship. I think this is okay. Scott Frost, former Nebraska QB, is doing a great job calling plays for their crazy quick offense. Oregon has been good for several years but the school doesn't have a national title. And everyone and their mother wanted FSU to lose, except of course direct FSU fans. So this game is positive for most.

I like that FSU didn't just get beat. They got whalloped. Pick an intimidating verb and you're probably correct. That's how the game went down. I'm not saying FSU didn't deserve to make the playoff -- they did -- but they didn't deserve to be in the final game, and now hopefully can focus on the intangibles surrounding their program, and players, and players' actions, in the off-season.

**4-Ohio State defeats 1-Alabama, 42-35.**

Here's where my words get more interesting.

I don't think Ohio State should have been the fourth spot in the playoffs. Not at all.

I would have picked TCU. Ignore the Big Ten championship briefly. TCU's loss is to Baylor (another 1-loss team). TCU beat Minnesota (bear with me), Oklahoma, OK State, West Virginia, and Kansas State, all either ranked when they played them or ranked by the end of the season. (Poor Oklahoma teams got screwed by season's end.)

Who'd OSU beat? Michigan State, which *is* a big win. And Minnesota. Which TCU also beat.

Who'd OSU lose to? *Virginia Tech*, who finished 6-6.

*What?*

Okay, so Ohio State's third string quarterback and the rest of his team mopped the floor with Wisconsin in the conference championship.. Yes. That's a thing that happened. We all saw it. But TCU doesn't have a conference championship to play in! They couldn't mop any floors with anyone! Even if you sidestep OSU's weird dumb loss and bring in another win against a ranked opponent, you *still* have less good wins in the program! *What!*

Add to all this that TCU *dismantled* Ole Miss yesterday in the Peach Bowl, **42-3**, and TCU fans probably feel pretty goddang bitter that they didn't get a shot at a championship.

As for the actual Bama-OSU game itself, well, I did actually watch the whole thing, with very few interruptions from the ESPN app, and I'm pretty disappointed.

I wanted Alabama to win! I am apparently in the minority on this! I know Ohio State is a Big Ten team and I am supposed to begrudgingly cheer for them because it is *just* and boosts our collective *pride*, but the problem is that I fucking despise Ohio State and I really don't care for their roughness (at times) or their silly-looking helmet stickers (all the time) or Urban Meyer, who is such a whiner (*ALL* the time) that he threw his headset because [he only got a 5-yard penalty instead of a 15-yard one.](http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2015/1/2/7479843/urban-meyer-chucks-headset-after-refs-call-unsatisfactory-penalty/in/7115974)

I wanted Alabama to flatten OSU. Anything to make TCU fans feel more justified in their anger that the system cheated them out of a chance. But that didn't happen.

Alabama didn't manage the clock well. Ohio State had a lot of big, impressive plays. That's how you win games, man, I dunno. That's football.

**2-Oregon vs. 4-Ohio State?**

Go Ducks.
