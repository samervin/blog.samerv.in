title: A trip to Colorado!
category: blog
---

So about a month ago, my family and I took an extended weekend trip in Colorado. And it's taken me a month to write about it! Yeah! Let's jump right in!

First, a note: western Nebraska and eastern Colorado look exactly the same. _Exactly_ the same. This makes sense, right, because the distinction is arbitrary. But I thought I would share.

We drove west to Denver before crossing into the mountains. If you've never driven through mountains before, it's kind of an experience. There are lots of ups and downs, plenty of guardrails, occasional tunnels, and great views.

Oh, and in Colorado: signs! Signs that are both hilarious _and_ informative!

The first sign you see, when you're about 5 miles from being out of the toughest part, says `Don't be fooled! 5 more miles of steep grades and sharp curves`. (I found a picture [here](https://traveloops.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/dont-be-fooled-2.jpg).)

This is brilliant! People are going to pay attention to this!

Another one that goes by when you have 2 or 3 miles left says something like `You are not done yet! 2 more miles of steep grades and sharp curves`. I couldn't find a picture of this one, but trust me, it's there.

There are also occasional runaway truck ramps, like the one [here](https://rosemarywashington.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_6577.jpg). These aren't _hilarious_ but I've never seen them before. Some are like the one in the picture, just big uphill slopes, while others are shorter and flatter with lots of water-filled barrels to cushion impacts.

There's also a sign somewhere near Denver that says, roughly, `Correctional facility nearby. Do not stop for hitchhikers`, which is just a little spooky!

We got to Breckenridge late Saturday, slept and got up Sunday morning to check out the town.

There are scads of shops in Breckenridge. Really, the whole town is like three-fourths tourist trap, one-fourth adrenaline junkie trap.

_serious selfies are for punks_

So we did a lot of shopping! On Sunday, I got some cool blue knit socks and a Devo shirt. Also, we found a "steampunk" hat in a store, for the bargain price of _four hundred dollars:_

If I was going to have a steampunk hat, I'd probably buy a regular hat, and encoggle it myself. I don't need no company to tell me what steampunk is!

We also took this extremely accurate picture of my dad.

We didn't buy any of the jerky for sale, though.

On Monday, we did a bit more shopping, and also did some hiking. We saw this adorable bear for sale, and if he wasn't heavy and also expensive I would have seriously considered picking him up.

We took the Sawmill trail a little way up one of the mountains, then hopped onto the Reservoir trail once we were higher. If you look closely, you can see those two trails in the lower left corner of [this map](http://www.gobreck.com/sites/default/files/pdf/TrailMap.pdf), the blue squares labeled 18 and 19.

Here's some cool pictures from the hike, with me, my little brother, and my dad. You can click them to make them bigger.

Come early Tuesday, we went towards Denver, stopping in Golden to ride the alpine slides!

I didn't really understand these until I saw one. It's a toboggan you can stop and start, and you ride it down a long water slide, but without any water. It's a huge amount of fun, definitely worth the money.

You can look that ish up on Google, or click [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Alpine_Slide_in_Golden.jpg) for a decent picture of the slide I rode on. That's not me.

We also stopped in Morrison to walk around the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. There's a hell of a lot of history here that I didn't realize. The place is over 100 years old. Some of the largest musicians in the last fifty years have played there, perhaps most notably the Beatles but also a hell of a lot of other people. (Complete list [here](http://redrocksonline.com/concerts-events/listing/archive).)

The steps/seats are open for anyone to walk on, and strangely we saw a lot of people exercising on them. One couple was running back and forth with weights, some kids were throwing a frisbee around, and one girl was actually high-stepping all the way up and down. I suppose it's a tough place to do your workout but it's way too public for my taste.

Before we made it all the way back into Denver, we did a little more driving around. This is a panorama taken from the top of a hill outside Frisco.

Colorado is pretty.

We finally drove into Denver proper, drove around in circles for a while trying to find a decent place to park, and ended up picking a parking lot about a mile from Coors Field, where the Rockies play.

We walked up to the stadium and went to our gate, which wasn't open for the game yet. After talking with the stadium employee, we found out that one of the gates -- exactly one! -- is open before the game starts for early fans to watch batting practice from beyond the outfield wall.

So we took the opportunity, _duh_

Not everyone taking batting practice was smacking balls to the wall, and plenty of guys were focusing on line drives and directing their hits. The obvious exception on the Cardinals was Matt Holliday, who was just hitting the cover off the ball every single time.

One of his home runs actually got near where we were sitting in the outfield. I didn't see where it was until it was almost in the seats, but my dad had a bead on it and made a try at catching it.

It smacked into his bare hand before he could grab it, bounced off (as baseballs hit 450 feet tend to do), and tumbled around some seats before a dude with a duffel bag picked it up and stashed it.

I'm pretty sure he already had two other balls in there. I don't think he needed that one. All my dad got out of it was a nasty bruise, which wasn't really worth it.

After batting practice wraps up, we find our way to our seats, the players are introduced, the scoreboard lights up, there's lots of clapping and singing, you know the drill, baseball.

There were probably more people in Cardinal shirts than there were in Rockies shirts. The Cardinals are a 120-year-old ball club with a lot of success, and the Rockies are a 22-year-old club with only one World Series appearance. So it makes a bit of sense.

However, the fans ultimately don't decide the score. I won't go into the nitty gritty details but suffice to say, St. Louis couldn't hit the ball, and the Rockies took advantage of an error, an injury for Matt Holliday (that's kept him out into July!) and a poor performance from John Lackey.

Rockies ended up winning 11-3.

After the game, we walked the walk of vague disappointment back to the car, and drove to our hotel room. We promptly went to bed. It was late and it had been a long weekend.

The next day we made the drive home.

So yeah! Colorado was a lot of fun! Lots of cool signs and mountains and sports!
