Previously, on this blog, we talked about the books in the [Ender's Game series]({{ site.url }}/blog/ender-series), and it was interesting, perhaps.

Well, if you liked that, let me try and talk to you about books again. *Ender's Shadow* came out in 1999, three years after the final book in the Ender series, and the fifth Ender-related book. It is set during the same time period as *Ender's Game*, but it follows the story of another character, Bean, whose name you'll recognize if you remember the original book.

If you're worried that Ender's Shadow is just a rehash of Ender's Game, well, don't worry. The story of Bean is plenty interesting on its own, and tracking his path as it crosses Ender's is well-done and even enhances the original book, if you're a careful reader (or have a strong memory). It can't beat the original, as no sequel can, but it's honestly my second-favorite Ender book, period. Perhaps there is just something about this conflict that makes it so great to make books about. Where are my further companion novels? I'd read 'em!

The Shadow series continues for four more books after *Ender's Shadow*, and it hasn't concluded yet, but it may have concluded for me, and I'll get to why below the fold. As is par for the course, **don't read below the fold if you don't want to be spoiled.** I'm going to take some special liberties with the most recent novel because I have pretty strong opinions about it. Be careful.

Alright. Initiating real talk.

*Ender's Shadow* is great. I love it. When I first started reading it, what bothered me the most was the strange excuses for this bean of a human, this inexplicably tiny and young, yet overly intelligent, creature to even exist. It didn't ruin anything for me, but I left the first fourth of the book with a strange taste in my mouth, the first time through. It seemed kind of hokey and made-up.

But what makes me love it is that the explanation for Bean's strangeness (unlike some of the explanations in later parts of the Ender series), is believable, grounded in reality but extrapolated to a place I feel is natural, and yet doesn't make him the king of the world.

Sure, some of Bean's dialog, and in particular moments that *had* to stay the same because they were in the original book, are slightly awkward. Bean's a smart kid and after reading his backstory, sometimes it's vaguely hard to believe a couple of the things he says, especially to Ender. But I don't think it hurts the book unduly; you can move on from it pretty easily.

Overall, the book has a lot of the same tones and messages as the original book, but from a different perspective and with a very different (in tone) ending. This is probably why I like it so much. Would recommend to any fan of *Ender's Game*. Orson Scott Card claims you can read this book without ever having *heard* of Ender, but I do think that would cheapen the experience of Ender's Game and I would always push for reading the original, every time.

So, the sequels.

*Shadow of the Hegemon* and *Shadow Puppets* are, to me, basically the same book. I'm not going to go into too many specifics like I did with the Ender series. These two books came out only a year apart and are very similarly written, and focus on much the same things: trying to avoid Achilles, trying to contact as many Battle Schoolers as possible, trying to say *jeesh* as much as possible (like, I know you needed a word to summarize "kids who fought with Ender," but did it have to be such a silly word?), trying not to die.

I think they're well-written. They don't have quite the punch that the original *Shadow* book does, but they're fast-paced, they have a lot of action, they have a lot of thinking, and they're grounded enough to feel like they matter.

Watching the countries play out a war, governed by children, is fascinating. Sure, they're a little more political than the original books. But they're not quite as thoughtful as the extended *Ender* books, which might put off a casual reader.

Anywho. *Shadow of the Giant* is nearly as good as the previous two books. Bean's giantism is becoming a serious problem. Achilles is gone but the world is still poised on the brink, and Peter manages to take charge by not taking charge and get everyone united. And he gets a cool book written about him by his magical still-living brother. There are a lot of good feelings in this book. The conflicts are all resolved well, except of course Bean and his Anton's Key'd children.

I can't say I'm a huge fan of Petra as she moves closer to motherhood. I don't think it's unnatural for it to happen, I'm not criticizing her or Card here. Just a personal comment. I sort of missed badass, piss-in-jars, trust-no-one Petra. Regardless. The point is, the first three sequels are all similar in style, are more similar to the original *Ender's Game* than any other sequels, and are mostly written well and are interesting. I had a good time reading them.

Okay. So here's where the strong opinions enter.

The most recent book in the Shadow series (which I believe is confirmed to continue) is *Shadows in Flight*, which follows Bean and his three Antonian children as they fly at relativistic speeds to try and seek a cure for their giantism.

Let me just jump in right now. Why the *hell* did Bean *insist* on giving two of his three children the most confusing names possible? Ender? Carlotta? *These characters are dead or gone.* It's confusing for the reader and the only thing it adds is a little colorful dialog when Bean is speaking to them.

This leads nicely into my biggest complaint.

*Nothing fucking happens.*

There is exactly one thing that occurs in the entire book, and it's dragged out across the entire final third of the book. The first two-thirds *is entirely dialog.*

And it's *boring.*

I don't know what changed between *Shadow of the Giant* and *Shadows in Flight* (besides about 7 years between publications), but all the characters, which means all the kids, speak to each other like they have to explain everything that they do and say. And then Bean steps in and challenges them, or reverses their thinking, and they're all so smart and full of themselves and augh.

I know they're supposed to be smart and full of themselves, but I have a harder time dealing with three of them who know what's happening rather than one who doesn't.

Okay, so the thing happens. They find an alien spaceship accidentally-on-purpose, and investigate. Yealright I'm down. I don't mind that. It's a nice change from overdiscussing everything.

What's awful is that even the dramatic parts, when the kids are on the ship and the creatures are running rabid and they're trying to figure out what to do and where to go, Card has to stick his big dumb "I am a science fiction writer" nose into the story.

There's a part in the book where Carlotta has to pull up a virtual map on the visor thing she's wearing. Communicating this can be as simple as, "She pulled up a virtual map on her visor and saw an open hallway" or whatever elegant thing you want to say.

But Card goes all out, and spends a paragraph describing how the map appeared in front of her, but was only visible to her because it was in her visor, and she could zoom in and zoom out by clicking her tongue, and *who the fuck cares we are trying to survive in an alien spaceship.*

Even after they finally meet the buggers (which, I'll admit, I started reading faster once it started getting wordy again), the only real conclusions that are made *directly* contradict the conclusions we explored in the Ender series. I just can't believe that the real Ender Wiggin wouldn't know about the true explanation behind the Formics and their not-quite-mind-control, given that he was best friends with a hive queen.

Then Bean dies, and it's sad. So we have a sequel with our favorite characters-named-after-other-characters to look forward to! (Not.)

I'm really disappointed in this book. The writing is sub-par, the dialog crowds the story, the only bits of action are slow despite having potential for drama, and the conclusions go against everything learned in much better books. What a waste.

-----

I gave a little recap in the *Ender* post and I'm going to do something similar here.

- *Ender's Shadow* is almost as good as *Ender's Game* and is a great book. If you liked Ender's Game, read this.

- The next three books, *Hegemon, Puppets, Giant*, are all similar (especially the first two) and are better for the casual fan who desires a bit more action and conflict than he'll ever find in the extended Ender series. They work well, are entertaining, and worth your time.

- *Shadows in Flight* sucks and I hate it and it's bad and a waste of time. Unless you're really pining to know what the continuing story is, you can skip it, and you can surely imagine something better.

- So, basically, you should read *Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Ender's Shadow,* and *Shadow of the Hegemon,* in some order. Once you've done that, you've read the best four Enderverse books, and if you're drawn to either of the sequel novels, read the next one or two. Then call me, because I want to talk about them.
