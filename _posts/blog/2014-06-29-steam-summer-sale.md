[Chuck's Challenge 3D](http://store.steampowered.com/app/262590/): It's certainly not Chip's Challenge, but in a lot of ways that's a good thing. The graphics aren't always on-par in terms of readability (and are occasionally just weird-looking, especially around corners) but the game itself is basically Chip's Challenge++ and I'm okay with that. Easy to drop in and out of.

[Pac-Man Championship Edition](http://store.steampowered.com/app/236450/): What an interesting game. It really has nothing at all to do with Pac-Man. Well it sort of does. You chomp around and collect dots and fruit as they appear, and periodically find a power pellet and go to town on the sometimes 50+ ghosts that are trailing you. It's a fast-paced arcade-type game.

[Monaco](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113020/) I honestly haven't done much with yet -- it seems like it's a lot better suited to local co-op or playing with friends. At least in the first few levels, which was all I tried at first, it doesn't explain the rules very well. Might have to come back to this one with someone else in the room.

[Borderlands 2, GOTY](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/32848/). Bought it mostly so I could play with friends. I wasn't the biggest fan ever of the first one -- clunky interface and a big empty world. This game, as far as I can tell thus far, doesn't change much of that, but Borderlands was always 1000% better with friends. Also, just in case you didn't know, the GOTY comes with *most* of the major DLCs, not all -- you miss out on the extra cosmetic stuff for your character as well as (I think) the last DLC giving you extra levels for your character.

[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/): Saw it on sale, was curious about it. A coworker summed up CS for me really well: "play gun game and deathmatch like a casual, have fun." That's most of what I've done so far and it's a blast. I don't have a lot of desire to get into the competitive modes, but it's a change-up from TF2 or Borderlands or what have you.

[Crimsonland](http://store.steampowered.com/app/262830/): A twin-stick shooter, remade from its original version for Steam and 2014. It's fun. I like it. I wish the stick controls were slightly different -- you have to actually pull the trigger to shoot, which feels really awkward, and you can't aim at all long-range. Keyboard + mouse feels way better, which kind of goes against the whole twin-stick philosophy. It has lots of co-op potential though, and plenty of content in weapons and skills and missions.

Less than $30 all told. Not bad.
