The numbered streets in Lincoln and Omaha run in opposite directions. In Lincoln, the numbers get bigger as you go east. In Omaha, the numbers get bigger as you go west.

Something I've wondered for a while is this: Is there a middle street between Omaha and Lincoln? Some enormous number, on which both sides decrease toward their respective cities?

The short answer is _no._ But the long answer is kind of interesting.

(Source on all this is just Google Maps, by the way.)

If you take O St, Highway 34, east from Lincoln, you'll make it all the way to 358th St before you hit Highway 50. (There's also a 361st near Weeping Water.) On the east side of Highway 50 is actually 156th, which goes north all the way into Omaha, sort of.

None of the roads southeast of Louisville continue north, though. All the roads stop at the Platte River, and it's mostly county roads on the other side.

Omaha's westernmost street is a little tougher to decipher. If you take Maple west, all the way to the Platte, you'll wind up just past 270th St, in Waterloo.

You can also follow Dodge west and northwest as it becomes Highway 275. The last road before Highway 275 goes straight north into Fremont is County Road 26. This is apparently also 324th St.

(In Fremont, numbered streets actually go _south to north._ What were they thinking.)

This is all interesting and good, especially for someone who doesn't travel outside of the main drags of these two cities often at all. But we haven't answered the question. __What's the middle street?__

Well, let's take 270th off of Maple from earlier (say, [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.2958329,-96.3403812,20z)), and draw a line directly south, across the Platte and I-80, to [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.9933437,-96.3403812,20z). We end up right between 262nd and 274th, outside of Ashland.

Halfway between the numbers 262 and 274 is 268. Assuming 270th does truly bisect Kimberly between 262nd and 274th, we need to go one hypothetical block east to find the common street number.

Here's a poorly traced map of all the streets I've mentioned (click for bigger):

So the middle street between Lincoln and Omaha is _sort of_ 269th. You heard it here first.
