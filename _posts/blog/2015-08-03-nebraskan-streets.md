title: Numbered streets in Nebraska

If you've ever traveled in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, you may have noticed that the numbered streets run in opposite directions. In Lincoln, the numbers get bigger as you go east. In Omaha, the numbers get bigger as you go west.

Something I've wondered for a while is this: Is there a middle street between Omaha and Lincoln? Some enormous number, on which both sides decrease toward their respective cities?

The short answer is _no._ But the long answer is kind of interesting.

(Source on all this is just Google Maps, by the way.)

If you take O St, Highway 34, east from Lincoln, you'll make it all the way to 358th St before you hit Highway 50. (There's also a 361st near Weeping Water.) On the east side of Highway 50 is actually 156th, which goes north all the way into Omaha, sort of.

None of the roads southeast of Louisville continue north, though, they all get killed by the Platte River, and it's mostly county roads on the other side.

Omaha's westernmost street is a little tougher to decipher. If you take Maple west, all the way to the Platte, you'll wind up just past 270th St, in Waterloo.

If you follow Dodge west, then northwest as it turns into Highway 275, the last road before 275 goes straight north into Fremont is County Road 26, which is apparently also 324th St.

(In Fremont, numbered streets actually go _south to north._ What were they thinking.)

This is all interesting and good, especially for someone who doesn't travel outside of the main drags of these two cities often at all. But we haven't answered the question. __What's the middle street?__

Well, if we take 270th off of Maple from earlier (like, [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.2958329,-96.3403812,20z)), and draw a line directly south, across the Platte and I-80, to [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.9933437,-96.3403812,20z), you end up right between 262nd and 274th, outside of Ashland.

Halfway between 262 and 274 is 268, so if you suppose that 270th does truly bisect Kimberly between 262nd and 274th, then we need to go one hypothetical block east to find the common street number.

Here's a poorly traced map of all the streets I've mentioned (click for bigger):

So the middle street between Lincoln and Omaha is _sort of_ 269th. You heard it here first.
