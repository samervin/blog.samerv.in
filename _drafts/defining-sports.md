This post is a somewhat unorganized collection of thoughts I have on what "sports" are, and what "good sports" are. etc

Track is not a sport.

Let me back up a second.

I don't like calling track a sport. I never have. It seems so simple: run around the track the fastest. Jump the highest. Throw the farthest. It's braindead. Entirely about training.

But what distinguishes track from something like baseball, or soccer? How *exactly* do you separate "real" sports from mere activities, or hobbies, or events?

In conversations I've had with my friends, and in thinking about this myself, I've come up with some criteria.

(A note: please don't interpret these to mean that people who run track, or participate in other non-sports per these guidelines, are not *athletes* -- they definitely are, and there is certainly a lot of time, work, and effort put into their training and competition. I just think that, on a base level, their competitions are not *sport*.)

- *A sport should be *physically demanding.** Lots of people believe this, though there is certainly a vocal minority against this. These are the same people who believe that chess is a sport, or that competitive gaming ("e-sports") are legitimately sports.

This is bunk. Sport is meant to be physical. It doesn't have to be about being the *biggest* or the fastest, to be clear. Weight classes in wrestling and boxing serve to emphasize *efficiency*. Sure, being weak is never advised, but that's part of the sport. You are working out and pushing the human body towards its physical limits, in order to compete harder and win more.

- *A sport should have *opponent interaction.** This is where lots of things that people generally consider "sports" get kicked out. Let me explain, with specific regards to track.

Practicing for track, and actually participating in a track meet, affects exactly one thing: the people running in the lane next to you, or the people jumping after you. The event is identical. You can run laps on a track and time them all you want, and you are getting *exactly the same result* as if you had joined the track team and gone to a meet.

Sport is not entirely about the physicality; sport is about preparing for and reacting to your opponent's moves. This does not supplant other guidelines! but is an important criterion. Curling, for example, is not a "sport", or at the very least is not a strong candidate for one. There is opponent interaction, but only minor physical abilities are required.

- *The outcome of a sporting event should be *unclear.** Further explanation on opponent interaction. If two people, training independently, record 4:00 and 4:05 mile times, then you can bet a healthy amount of money that the person recording 4:00 will win if the athletes were to go head-to-head. This information isn't often available, to be sure, but there is no "style of play" factor to consider when running track. Either you run fast or you don't.

There exist different styles of play for football teams. Some prefer option plays, some throw the ball excessively, some rely on the run, some have different defensive schemes. All of these factors play into match-ups: if a good team encounters a style of play they've never seen before, the outcome will be unclear, because the theoretically better team is ill-prepared!

A laundry list of sports that are **NOT** sports under these criteria, yet are often traditionally considered sports:

Track. Cross country. Archery, and other aiming/throwing activities. Skateboarding, and other "board" activities. Skiing. Cycling. Billiards, and other table-top games. Horse racing. Fishing. Golf. Gymnastics. Hunting. Swimming and diving. Weightlifting. Car racing. Chess, and other board games. E-sports.

I bet that list offended everyone, at least once. You're all still *athletes*! I respect the work you put in! I certainly wouldn't want to work for it myself! But you don't play a sport. Sorry.

List of real sports:

Baseball (but it's low on the list). Hockey. Soccer. Football. Volleyball. Basketball. Tennis. Racquetball, badminton, and similar. Rugby. Cricket. Polo. Wrestling. Boxing. Fighting, as in MMA or traditional martial arts. Roller derby. Ultimate Frisbee. Paintball.

So now we know what a sport is. What makes a *good* sport? Here, I am referring primarily to sports that good for *spectators*, which is a nonessential yet massive part of sporting.

Hockey, volleyball.
