title: I stopped locking my bike.

On February 26th of this year, I decided to stop locking my bike up. Not at home, not at work, not at school. Never.

Here's the justification. My bike is kind of a piece. Almost every exposed piece of bare metal is rusty. The gear shifter works on most days, though the plastic covering the gear shifter has fallen off and you have to know what gear you're in. The back brakes had to be taken off because they kept rubbing on the rear tire, which is all kinds of crooked. The whole thing whines, squeals, and creaks when I bike up hills. Even the seat fabric has torn away, revealing the foam underneath.

So, bottom line, I'm going to get a new bike sometime this spring or early summer. So I figured I had a lot to gain, two major things in particular:

1. Not locking or unlocking my bike saves me about six lockings a day, four days a week. If each locking takes a minute and change, that's half an hour a week saved. And I don't have to fiddle with the damn thing with cold fingers (though this is becoming less of a problem).
1. I was curious whether anything would happen to it. I've heard stories of people leaving their bikes unchained exactly one time before it vanished. And I was curious about the relative likelihood of having a bike stolen downtown vs. on campus vs. in the apartment complex.

And really, the only thing that would be lost would be the trips for a day or two. After that, I'd go buy a new bike. Seemed like a foolproof plan to me.
