If I was picking, who would I put in Super Smash Bros. as DLC?

I spent my [offical vote](https://cp.nintendo.co.jp/us/) on **CommanderVideo**, the hero of some of the BIT.TRIP video games. His moveset would have to largely be created, but he has a few moves built-in from his games, and he has quite a few games to pull inspiration from. He's similar to Pac-Man in that the BIT.TRIP series are mostly 2D, but his 3D model from Runner 2 would work well for an in-game model. Runner 2 also provides a full suite of alternate costumes.

Another character with a full suite of possible moves is **Isaac** from the Binding of Isaac games. Some care would have to be taken to keep his particular moves kid-friendly, but there's plenty of items Isaac can find that aren't disgusting, dirty, or otherwise negative.
