Go listen to [Little Black Submarines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJEx2tOYhHk), by the Black Keys.

Okay. good. Did you like it? I hope so. Were you reminded of any artist, or song by that artist, in particular?

Don't take this as an insult to the Black Keys -- I like this song, really! I don't think it's a ripoff, or anything like that. But the first time I heard it, it was playing quietly on my friend's car radio and I actually thought it *was* Stairway to Heaven. Interesting either way.
