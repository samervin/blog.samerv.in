From <a href="http://tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?t=512">this thread</a> over on <a href="http://tetrisconcept.net/forum/">tetrisconcept.net</a>, and most importantly from <a href="http://tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?t=512&amp;page=10">this page</a> onward for the casual observer.

To briefly sum up the discoveries: because of the incorrect usage of an OR operator in Tetris Worlds, the probabilities of certain pieces are <em>very</em> skewed away from the roughly 1/7 probability that ought to be guaranteed.

The T piece comes up 21% (more than a <em>fifth</em>) of the time, where the lowly L piece comes in at 9% (less than a <em>tenth</em>).

That's whack.
