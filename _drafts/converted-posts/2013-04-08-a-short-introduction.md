I've decided to switch my silly blogging escapades over to this new site here, from the old Tumblr account. Not that the interface for Tumblr wasn't dead simple and easy to use, two things I liked, but all the absolute shit that populates that website was too silly to handle.

I've decided to run through all my posts on the old site and grab the important and interesting ones and throw them up over here. Sort of a best-of-the-last-two-and-a-half-years thing. I intend to delete the old blog in some reasonable stretch of time so if there was anything pressing you wanted, you should do something about it sooner than later.

So, welcome!
