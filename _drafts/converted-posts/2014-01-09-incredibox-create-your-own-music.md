With no introduction, you need to give this a try:Â <a href="http://www.incredibox.com/v3/">http://www.incredibox.com/v3/</a>

With an introduction: this website lets you drag and drop beats, sounds, melodies, and small voice parts, 7 at a time, into the window for cartoon beatboxers to sing for you. It's hypnotizing, well-put-together, includes a secret video, and has a shuffle mode you can just leave on (which I am).

Give it a shot. For background music, it almost can't be beat.
