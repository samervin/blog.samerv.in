The Tunnel Walk of shame is a website run by a big Husker fan who likes to take the players and coaches through a image/text journey every time there's a game coming up. It's generally funny stuff, particularly for those who understand Husker football culture reasonably well.

Well, in the spirit of the basketball team's trip to the tournament, he decided to make fun of all them too, and it's incredible.
