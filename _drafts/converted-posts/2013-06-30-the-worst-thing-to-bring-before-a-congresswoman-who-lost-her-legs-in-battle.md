A video, explained somewhat over at <a href="http://www.upworthy.com/whats-the-worst-thing-you-could-say-to-a-congresswoman-who-lost-her-legs-in-battle-found-it">this link</a>. A man tries to get veterans' assistance for spraining his ankle and Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois won't take any of his crap. The opening of the video is fine, especially to hear the man speak, but she really revs up around the 4:30 mark. Well worth a watch.
