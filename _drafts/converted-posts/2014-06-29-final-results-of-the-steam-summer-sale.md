Chuck's Challenge 3D: It's certainly not Chip's Challenge, but in a lot of ways that's a good thing. The graphics aren't always on-par in terms of readability (and are occasionally just weird and incorrect) but the game itself is basically Chip's Challenge++ and I'm okay with that. Easy to drop in and out of.

Pac-Man Championship Edition: What an interesting game. It really has nothing at all to do with Pac-Man. Well it sort of does. You chomp around and collect dots and fruit as they appear, and periodically find a power pellet and go to town on the sometimes 50+ ghosts that are trailing you. It's a fast-paced arcade-type game.

Monaco I honestly haven't done much with yet -- it seems like it's a lot better suited to local co-op or playing with friends. At least in the first few levels, which was all I tried at first, it doesn't explain the rules very well. Might have to come back to this one with someone else in the room.

Borderlands 2, GOTY. Bought it mostly so I could play with friends. I wasn't the biggest fan ever of the first one -- clunky interface and a big empty world. This game, as far as I can tell thus far, doesn't change much of that, but Borderlands was always 1000% better with friends. Also, just in case you didn't know, the GOTY comes withÂ <em>most</em> of the major DLCs, not all -- you miss out on the extra cosmetic stuff for your character as well as (I think) the last DLC giving you extra levels for your character.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive: Saw it on sale, was curious about it. A coworker summed up CS for me really well: "play gun game and deathmatch like a casual, have fun." That's most of what I've done so far and it's a blast. I don't have a lot of desire to get into the competitive modes, but it's a change-up from TF2 or Borderlands or what have you.

Crimsonland: A twin-stick shooter, remade from its original version for Steam and 2014. It's fun. I like it. I wish the stick controls were slightly different -- you have to actually pull the trigger to shoot, which feels really awkward, and you can't aim at all long-range. Keyboard + mouse feels way better, which kind of goes against the whole twin-stick philosophy. It has lots of co-op potential though, and plenty of content in weapons and skills and missions.

Less than $30 all told. Not bad.
