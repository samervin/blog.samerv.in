My floor had a huge Brawl tourney over last semester and the beginning of this semester. We crowned a champion a while ago and I said I'd try and pull some stats from the data files, out of curiosity. Well, here we are, months later, and I'm finally getting around to it.

Here's the first installment: a compilation of all the characters played in all the matches during the round robin (regular season play). The three numbers are thus: number of times chosen at character select, number of times received from random, total games played. SomeÂ notes follow.
<ol>
	<li>Sheilda - 72 - 2 - 74</li>
	<li>Link - 49 - 5 - 54</li>
	<li>Ike - 47 - 7 - 54</li>
	<li>Samus - 30 - 8 - 38</li>
	<li>Lucas - 29 - 7 - 36</li>
	<li>Captain Falcon - 33 - 3 - 36</li>
	<li>Kirby - 28 - 6 - 34</li>
	<li>Pit - 27 - 5 - 32</li>
	<li>Toon Link - 26 - 3 - 29</li>
	<li>Falco - 23 - 3 - 26</li>
	<li>ROB - 20 - 5 - 25</li>
	<li>Mr. Game and Watch - 21 - 1 - 22</li>
	<li>Ganondorf - 21 - 0 - 21</li>
	<li>Snake - 14 - 6 - 20</li>
	<li>Wolf - 17 - 2 - 19</li>
	<li>Donkey Kong - 10 - 8 - 18</li>
	<li>Mario - 14 - 3 - 17</li>
	<li>Lucario - 14 - 1 - 15</li>
	<li>Peach - 8 - 6 - 14</li>
	<li>Ness - 6 - 7 - 13</li>
	<li>Zero Suit Samus - 12 - 0 - 12</li>
	<li>Pikachu - 7 - 4 - 11</li>
	<li>Luigi - 5 - 6 - 11</li>
	<li>Yoshi - 9 - 1 - 10</li>
	<li>Fox - 6 - 2 - 8</li>
	<li>King Dedede - 4 - 4 - 8</li>
	<li>Pokemon Trainer - 4 - 3 - 7</li>
	<li>Diddy Kong - 3 - 4 - 7</li>
	<li>Marth - 3 - 4 - 7</li>
	<li>Olimar - 3 - 4 - 7</li>
	<li>Wario - 0 - 7 - 7</li>
	<li>Jigglypuff - 4 - 2 - 6</li>
	<li>Sonic - 2 - 4 - 6</li>
	<li>Bowser - 4 - 1 - 5</li>
	<li>Ice Climbers - 1 - 4 - 5</li>
	<li>Meta Knight - 0 - 3 - 3</li>
</ol>
Some notes:
<ul>
	<li>I didn't separate Sheik and Zelda matches when I first started keeping track, because the people that were playing switched often enough that they blurred together, and once I thought about it more it was too late to change it. In hindsight, I ought to have distinguished between games where only one fighter was used vs. both. A nontrivial portion of the Sheilda population is due to a couple Zelda-only players.</li>
	<li>Ganondorf didn't come up on Random, ever. Which is funny.</li>
	<li>Neither did Zero Suit Samus, but of course she can't (which is silly). All 12 ZSS matches are from the same person.</li>
	<li>No one picked Wario, ever. In fact most of the high-tier characters (Diddy Kong, Pikachu, Marth, Wario, Ice Climbers, Olimar) are in the bottom half of the graph. Just goes to show which characters are generally more fun, I think.</li>
	<li>I was the only person who ever chose Jigglypuff (all 4 selections are mine). I dunno, she's fun, but apparently I'm in the minority.</li>
	<li>Meta Knight was banned from character selection, but not from Random, just to be funny about it.</li>
</ul>
