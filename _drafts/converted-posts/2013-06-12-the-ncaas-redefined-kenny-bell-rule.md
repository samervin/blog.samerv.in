As seen at <a href="http://www.cornnation.com/2013/6/12/4421704/ncaa-kenny-bell-hard-hit-wisconsin-defenseless">this link</a> from Corn Nation.

Essentially, the definition of a defenseless player has been widened to add "a player who receives a blind-side block."

I won't beat this point into the ground, but this is entirely silly. The more stupid rules they add to football the less I want to watch it.

Instead, I'm going to watch this over and over again:
