If you don't know what I'm talking about or don't remember, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5964960/nebraskas-kenny-bell-delivered-the-best-legal-block-in-college-football-this-season-so-of-course-he-was-flagged-for-it">this Deadspin article</a> covers it pretty well. (And plays it in slow-motion, which is fantastic.)

Let's dial up the original gif, in all its glory:

Fantastic. Now, what happens if we, ah, take Kenny out?

Not only does this prove even harder that this was a technically clean hit, it also looks like something out of goddamn <em>Paranormal Activity</em>.

Happy Halloween!
