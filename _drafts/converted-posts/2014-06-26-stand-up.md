So, at Hudl, the team is split up into squads of 8 or so, and every morning our squad does what's called a "stand-up," where we stand in a circle and talk about what we worked on the day before and what we're going to be working on today. It's just a quick opportunity to stay up-to-date on what everyone's doing.

One of my coworkers has been trying to, if he remembers, play the beginning of the Ludacris song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZG7IK99OvI">Stand Up</a>. Which is great, but it devolves into rap or whatever pretty quickly, so the effect is limited. So, on company time because company-related work, I made a short version that just loops the opening 8 seconds or so.

You can grab that <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19978518/Stand%20Up%20Loop.mp3">here</a>. That's in my Dropbox, so it won't be there forever, but you can always email me if you're really curious. I'm pretty happy with how it came out.
