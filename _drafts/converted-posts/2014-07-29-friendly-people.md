So today I was at Barnes and Noble, doing the thing that I always do -- looking at the World War II books, because I'm a big fan of WWII stuff. I was mostly just browsing when a girl who was looking at books down the aisle came up and said hi.

She asked if I'd read any of the books up there, and if I had a favorite. I pointed out <em>Flyboys</em>, which might be my second-favorite book (behind Ender's Game), <em>The Pacific War</em>, which I haven't read all the way through but is one of the most complete sources about the USA-Japan conflict, and <em>Band of Brothers</em>, which was the book that they made an HBO series out of.

She seemed genuinely interested, told me she liked history but preferred Civil War-era stuff, which there aren't quite as many books written about. She asked where I was going to school, I told her, and she said she was actually going to school in South Dakota and was just down for the week visiting family.

We chit-chatted for just a bit longer before she said see ya, and thanks. It was really nice to have a brief, friendly conversation with someone. I hope that happens again.
