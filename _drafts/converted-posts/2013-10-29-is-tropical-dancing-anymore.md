I'm not even sure how I was linked to this, but this is a music video unlike any otherâ€”summing up both the near-future possibilities of virtual reality and, well, the disgusting mind of a boy.

This contains mostly-naked women (and some men too), and is certainly <strong>not safe for work</strong>. Enjoy at your own risk.

[edit: also worth checking out is the same band's video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwrbyVaC6EU">The Greeks</a>, which contains much cartoon blood and explosions but is also interesting in its execution.]
