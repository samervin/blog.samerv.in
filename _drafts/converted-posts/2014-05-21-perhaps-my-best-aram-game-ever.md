I don't really consider myself a League-r, but I'll hop on for a couple games of ARAM now and again. I love playing Lux, day or night. (And I recently bought Ziggs, who is almost as fun.)

In this game, out of all 12 people, I died the least, did the most total damage, had the biggest killing streak (8), and generally had a fucking blast. It wasn't a blowout, not until towards the end (and they always are towards the end).

Sometime soon I'll post an update on my fresh new job that I'm almost two weeks deep in!
