Just a heads-up, known to those of you following me on Twitter: I scanned bits and pieces of my childhood notebooks and am getting the best of the best and posting them to another blog, along with some names and concepts and other things I wrote up back in my creative heyday.

You can follow that blog separately over at <a href="http://notebookdrawings.wordpress.com/">http://notebookdrawings.wordpress.com/</a> if you're interested (or follow the link up top), I won't post about it much here.

And just a friendly reminder, the Manfighter Dev Log (link also above) is still alive and kicking, progress is slow and steady!
