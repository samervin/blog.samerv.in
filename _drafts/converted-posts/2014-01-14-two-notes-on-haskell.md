<p style="text-align:left;">First, this comic from xkcd:Â <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/haskell.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-365 aligncenter" alt="haskell" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/haskell.png" width="225" height="321" /></a></p><p>Then <a href="http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20070219/044101.html">this link</a>, a metaphor for cheating on your regular programming language (be it Python or anything else) with the impressively kinky Haskell.</p><p>In one of my CS classes last semester, we had to use Haskell. It's interesting, sure, and elegant for small, useful functions. But for large projects? I'd rather take the long way around in a traditional language and know exactly what I'm doing.</p>
