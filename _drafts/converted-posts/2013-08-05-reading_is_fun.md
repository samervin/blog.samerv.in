<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/sex-drugs-cocoa-puffs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-264" alt="sex drugs cocoa puffs" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/sex-drugs-cocoa-puffs.jpg?w=195" width="195" height="300" /></a>My range of books I typically enjoy reading is somewhat limited in scope. I like a little bit of sci-fi, <em>Ender's Game</em> and its entire universe of sequels are some of my favorite books. I like a little bit of techno-thriller, Michael Crichton's <em>Prey</em> was amazing, and it's very cool to make fun of Dan Brown but I really liked <em>Deception Point</em> and <em>Digital Fortress</em>. I like World War II stories, <em>Flyboys</em> is one of my favorite all-time books, <em>Unbroken</em> was fantastic, and various other books (particularly about the Pacific theater) were all very very interesting.

But that's about all. Sure, I've read and liked other books. But that's essentially my collection.

My ladyfriend and I, in some attempt to be more informed and more interesting and more cool, have switched books. I gave her <em>Flyboys</em>, which is probably not really her cup of tea but certainly had a big impact on me. And she gave me <em>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</em>, a strange book by Chuck Klosterman, a collection of essays on pop culture and how it affects, well, everything.

Thus far it's funny, makes some good points, and is enjoyable if nothing else. It sparked a discussion about the impact of <em>The Real World</em> with my dad, which was provoking and is interesting in and of itself.
