From my dad:
<blockquote>So there’s a kid working in the bagging line at a supermarket. He works there often; just does his job. One day, his manager brings in a new piece of technology: a machine that can take oranges and grind them into fresh-squeezed orange juice. The kid asks his manager, “Hey, you think I could try that out sometime?” The manager replies, “Nope, sorry kid… baggers can't  be juicers.</blockquote>
From the Culver's kitchen:

The Red Sox fan yells, “This is for Boston!” and jumps off the side of the mountain. Not to be outdone, the Cardinals fan yells, “This is for St Louis!” and pushes the Cubs fan off the mountain.</blockquote>
From my own stupid mouth:
<blockquote>My toes are <em>freezing</em>. I wish I had some sort of… toe-gloves. … actually I think they call those “socks."</blockquote>

From Chuck Palahniuk's "Survivor":
<div style="display:inline !important;">
<blockquote>Long-term, we’re all going to die. Then our bodies will rot. No surprise there. Short-term, we’re all going to live happily ever after. Really. So don’t sweat it. You can just relax and let things happen. Disasters, like pain, and misery. And Joy, and Serenity, and Happiness, and Contentment. You don’t have to control everything. You can’t control everything. If you worry about disaster all the time, that’s what you’re going to get. I want you to know I won’t always be here, but I’ll always find you. No matter what happens, no matter what you do, it’s the right thing. You just have to trust me.</blockquote>

	<li>If you don’t know what you’re doing, at least do it neatly.</li>
	<li>What if laughing gas really did?</li>
	<li>Would the world have been different if Einstein had owned a hairbrush?</li>
	<li>If you smell an odorless gas, leave the room immediately.</li>
