I got to go through a Sparq camp! I've had to explain this to a few people, so I'll break it down:

The NFL does this thing called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_scouting_combine">NFL scouting combine</a>, and it's a week-long event where invited players (aka the creamÂ of the incoming draft class) get invited to test their strength, speed, and agility in measurable ways. It's something that NFL teams, and the public, use to rank athletes, and while it's not the final say in who's good, it certainly helps competition.

Nike does this thing called a <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/us-football/sparq">Sparq camp</a>, which is similar but much smaller and for high schoolers (and 7th / 8th graders), and it consists of four events: a 40-yard dash, a run-left, run-right, run-left agility test, a kneeling medicine ball throw, and a vertical jump. It's partially to track your improvement, partially to show to colleges, and partially to rank yourself across all high school athletes, which Nike does with some form of ranking.

Hudl, who partners with Nike to get Sparq data on up their website for athletes who have completed these camps, decided to coordinate one of these camps in-house, just for a little friendly competition. So I jumped for it!

I don't remember my stats exactly. My 40-yard dash was around 5.2 seconds, I think. My agility score was worse, closer to 6 (and in my defense, I didn't have cleats). I don't even remember the ball toss. It was miserable. But I managed to get 27 inches on the vertical leap, which is just slightly below the apparent average of 27.3 inches measured from all of last year's camps. In fact, it's only half an inch lower than Clay Matthews' score when he went through the camp [same link above]. That's sort of cool.

I'm really curious how I did relative to the other Hudlies. Not first, I know that, but I'm curious where I am. If being a goalie did nothing else for me in life, at least it let me jump okay.
