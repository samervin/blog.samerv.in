Kind of on a whim, we came up with a fairly simple five-part drinking game, should any of us ever feel the need.</p><ol><li><span style="line-height:13px;">Take a drink whenever someone (usually Jack) unsheathes his sword and it makes aÂ <em>shiiiiing</em> noise. The noise is crucial.</span></li><li>Take a drink whenever there is a close-up of Jack's face and his eyebrows are tense, with visible wrinkle lines.</li><li>Take a drink at the start of every slow motion sequence. For long sequences, you don't have to keep drinking. We're not advocating death.</li><li>Take a drink every time the screen splits to show multiple characters or actions. Hardcore mode: take a drink for every split.</li><li>Finish your drink every time something is reflected in Jack's sword. This one is rarer, but much much cooler.</li></ol><p>Remember, binge drinking is bad, kiddos.</p>
