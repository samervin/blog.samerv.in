So AirDroid is an app for Android phones that gives you a large amount of control over your Android phone from your computer over a wireless network. You can access photos, text people, and generally manipulate the phone in every way you could manipulate it normally, but with a keyboard and with native upload/download behavior, the most convenient of things.

You can also control the camera. Which, aside from being mostly pointless, is also sort of fun if you point it at the screen.
