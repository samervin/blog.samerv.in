Taken from <a href="http://wastedonsteam.com/">this website</a>, which seems to work much better if you log in rather than trying to just do a search for a username.

All the games I've played more than 10 hours in:
<ol>
	<li>Team Fortress 2, with 2105 hours played. A decent chunk of that is raw idling hours. But I still think more than half is legitimate playtime. Which is insane.</li>
	<li>Dungeons of Dredmor, with 170 hours. One of the biggest time sinks ever. There is so much to do here, and so much I haven't even done.</li>
	<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, with 47 hours. For whatever reason, the site missed this one.</li>
	<li>Audiosurf, with 41 hours. This number rocks. Music rocks. Go buy this.</li>
	<li>Alien Swarm, with 29 hours played. I didn't actually realize I'd played this that much. Just goes to show you, free games with only one campaign can be fun too.</li>
	<li>Super Monday Night Combat, with 27 hours. It's my understanding that basically no one plays this game anymore. It was fun but was ultimately too finnicky and hard.</li>
	<li>Monday Night Combat, with 26 hours. Billed as TF2 with turrets, it was some weird combination of that and a more traditional third-person shooter. It worked reasonably well and I played it quite a bit for a while.</li>
	<li>The Binding of Isaac, with 24 hours. This game is hard hard hard and remains fun fun fun. I lost a bit of the spark to play this after a friend of mine got much much better at it than I ever did, and beat the game (or got really close). Hey Andy. Fuck you.</li>
	<li>Borderlands, with 23 hours. I think a few of those were lost to my computer overheating and slowing down, before I figured out what was wrong. Still a game that needed friends to finish.</li>
	<li>Portal 2, with 21 hours. Both campaigns were lots of fun and occasionally jumping into community puzzles is good fun too.</li>
	<li>Bit Trip Runner 2, with 19 hours. I'm going to beat this game. This number's going to go up.</li>
	<li>Fallout: New Vegas, with 17 hours. The world is just so big and it's easy to get lost in it.</li>
	<li>Cubemen, with 14 hours. A great relaxing game. I played most of the levels through, though.</li>
	<li>Bastion, with 13 hours. I keep meaning to go back and grab some of the endgame achievements, but it never happens. Still a fantastic work.</li>
	<li>Poker Night 2, with 12 hours. I'm going to unlock all of the items if it kills me. And it might.</li>
	<li>10,000,000, with 12 hours. This game was a really fun time waster, easy to pick up and put down.</li>
	<li>And Terraria, with 11 hours.</li>
</ol>
