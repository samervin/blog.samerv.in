  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've decided to switch my silly blogging escapades over to this new site here, from the old Tumblr account. Not that the interface for Tumblr wasn't dead simple and easy to use, two things I liked, but all the absolute shit that populates that website was too silly to handle.

I've decided to run through all my posts on the old site and grab the important and interesting ones and throw them up over here. Sort of a best-of-the-last-two-and-a-half-years thing. I intend to delete the old blog in some reasonable stretch of time so if there was anything pressing you wanted, you should do something about it sooner than later.

So, welcome!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[From my dad:
<blockquote>So there’s a kid working in the bagging line at a supermarket. He works there often; just does his job. One day, his manager brings in a new piece of technology: a machine that can take oranges and grind them into fresh-squeezed orange juice. The kid asks his manager, “Hey, you think I could try that out sometime?” The manager replies, “Nope, sorry kid… baggers can't  be juicers.</blockquote>
From the Culver's kitchen:
<blockquote>Zach: Praise baby Jesus!
Me: ... why baby Jesus?
Zach: Because he was the cutest of all the Jesus-es.</blockquote>
From somewhere in Tumblr (though surely not originally):
<blockquote>An infinite number of mathematicians walks into a bar. The first goes up to the bartender and says, “I’ll have a pint of lager, please.” Each next one says, “and I’ll have half of what he’s having.” The bartender says, “You’re all idiots,” and pulls two pints.</blockquote>
From my former history teacher:
<blockquote>And what happened to those towns that the railroads didn't run through? They were literally ghost towns!</blockquote>
From my dad:
<blockquote>Eli: I am NOT THROWING a TANTRUM!
Dad: Yes you are! You are doing it right now! This is specifically what you are doing at this moment!</blockquote>
From Russ Isham:
<blockquote>‎It violates mathematics, but we’re engineers, we don’t care.</blockquote>
From Tony Kornheiser:
<blockquote>My favorite president was Warren G. Harding, because the G stood for Gangster!</blockquote>
From Aaron Campbell:
<blockquote>A Cardinals fan, a Cubs fan, and a Red Sox fan are all climbing up the side of the mountain arguing about who loves their team more. The Red Sox fan yells, “This is for Boston!” and jumps off the side of the mountain. Not to be outdone, the Cardinals fan yells, “This is for St Louis!” and pushes the Cubs fan off the mountain.</blockquote>
From my own stupid mouth:
<blockquote>My toes are <em>freezing</em>. I wish I had some sort of… toe-gloves. … actually I think they call those “socks."</blockquote>
From my dad:
<blockquote>A man has basically two emotions: hungry and horny. If your man doesn’t currently have an erection, make him a sandwich.</blockquote>
From Chris Breault:
<blockquote>Like Bubble Bobble, Excel does have an ending, but almost nobody sees it.</blockquote>
From Isaac Damery:
<blockquote>The force of attraction is greater than or equal to the sum of my parts.</blockquote>
From Kyle Kenny, misinterpreting "Peace of Mind":
<blockquote>All I want is to have my piece of pie!</blockquote>
From George Carlin:
<blockquote>I love and treasure individuals as I meet them; I loathe and despise the groups they identify with and belong to.</blockquote>
From Fake Bo Pelini:
<blockquote>If you must know, we don’t have any official “wildcat” plays — Rex just tells Martinez to get out of his way sometimes</blockquote>
From Lord of War:
<blockquote>There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That’s one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is…

How do we arm the other 11?</blockquote>
From Sarah Malone:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Why is there barbecue sauce under my fingernails?</li>
	<li>Food is literally the only reason I’m going to prom this year.</li>
	<li>Submitting websites for review is just a placebo, it’s there to make you feel better. <em>about our school’s content filter</em></li>
	<li>That cloud may or may not have a phallic shape. <em>one weather site is blocked, misclassified under “pornography”</em></li>
	<li>There’s this picture on the internet that always makes me laugh… it’s a picture of a dead squirrel in a kiddie pool, and the caption just says, “you okay?”</li>
	<li>I <strong>AM </strong>moral support! <em>instead of actually helping</em></li>
	<li>I don’t think I've taken this jacket off in the last three days. It’s like the dumbest thing I own.</li>
	<li>You know when you’re so tired that your nose runs? <em>No!</em></li>
	<li>When I first got my cat, she would stand outside my door and meow meow meow, and then she would fart and just walk away.</li>
	<li>It’s hugging you in binary! <em>someone accidentally inserted a 0 into their paper</em></li>
	<li>Oh my God, your fingers are, like, they go at an angle! How do you do that? <em>someone’s double-jointed</em></li>
	<li>I’m sorry for opening my mouth today.</li>
	<li>Watermelon gum is a crime against nature. Why does it exist?</li>
	<li>Roosevelt, were you the one that put the porn on the school computers? <em>Roosevelt never would</em></li>
	<li>I hate babies.</li>
	<li>I <em>hate </em>babies!</li>
	<li>I like how Internet Explorer is always giving you crap like, “Want to make me your default browser? Please? Do you remember me?”</li>
	<li>I’m insulted by popcorn and chocolate! <em>putting them together is awful, apparently</em></li>
	<li>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are Rainbow Dash, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Applejack. <em>Duh</em></li>
	<li>That was a laugh? I was just going to pass it off as a dolphin. <em>I laugh weird, sometimes</em></li>
	<li>You ever feel dirty for touching the floors here? I do. Where’s my sanitizer?</li>
	<li>You can’t have more than six dildos in Texas? What am I gonna do? I’m not moving to Texas.</li>
	<li>Wyoming’s not a real state!</li>
	<li>That was how my parents knew I was going to be an artist, I was always making shit paintings on the wall.</li>
	<li>Could you make that face again? You looked kind of like a pooping baby.</li>
	<li>Can you see the blood coursing through your veins too? I can feel the blood coursing all the way from my feet to my shoulders. I don’t know if I should even go outside. I’d be a queen in medieval England, though! And I’d have the plague!</li>
	<li>I hate scat, but poop is hilarious.</li>
	<li>I just got a lot of hate into my body!</li>
	<li>If this gave you a boner, you’re a victim of society.</li>
	<li>All Team Fortress 2 fanfiction is basically Medic touching Heavy’s butt and Heavy saying “Sandvich!”</li>
	<li>That just gave me gas for a minute!</li>
	<li>I’m so excited that it’s getting warmer. It’s ugly sweater time again!</li>
	<li>I was 14 years old, I had raccoon eyes, my titties were hanging out everywhere, there was hot pink on me all the time…it was gross.</li>
	<li>When I was a kid, holy macaroni there were tits <em>everywhere!</em></li>
	<li>Man, I hate people, but I love Pokemon!</li>
	<li>Remember when I was quiet? <em>(No!)</em></li>
	<li>I’m just a fat gay. (<em>You’re not fat.) (But you are gay.)</em></li>
	<li>For a second I thought there was poop on my shoe, but it’s just mud. That’s cool too.</li>
	<li>I make Santorum look homosexual!</li>
	<li>Everything sounds funny right now. I think I’m getting sick.</li>
	<li>I get on my Neopets like every time we’re in the computer lab.</li>
	<li>I always kind of feel bad for those people…just kidding, I don’t give a shit about anybody but myself!</li>
	<li>I took off my jacket in an attempt to feel normal, but it’s so cold!</li>
	<li>I forgot that Megaupload was down, and I went to pirate some song and the site said “THIS HAS BEEN SEIZED BY THE US GOVERNMENT” and it made me want to cry. And pee a little.</li>
	<li>Oh I just spit all over this. Cool.</li>
	<li>I don’t know what you just said, but it sounded like “I got the bad part of a hair rim job.”</li>
	<li>KAWAII DESU NUUUUH~</li>
	<li>I’d rather have an enema of acid and sandpaper than watch an episode of Family Guy.</li>
	<li>I don’t even remember what I’m talking about anymore.</li>
	<li>I’m pregnant from all the heterosexual sex I've been having. I’m a slut. I love the male genitalia.</li>
	<li>I flipped out and verbally tore this girl’s head off and she wrote me an apology letter the next day. Yes.</li>
	<li>I went [here] for elementary school, and I’m glad I saw none of you there. I was a little shit!</li>
	<li>You guys are, like, the few people I don’t hate.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
From Chuck Palahniuk's "Survivor":
<div style="display:inline !important;">
<blockquote>Long-term, we’re all going to die. Then our bodies will rot. No surprise there. Short-term, we’re all going to live happily ever after. Really. So don’t sweat it. You can just relax and let things happen. Disasters, like pain, and misery. And Joy, and Serenity, and Happiness, and Contentment. You don’t have to control everything. You can’t control everything. If you worry about disaster all the time, that’s what you’re going to get. I want you to know I won’t always be here, but I’ll always find you. No matter what happens, no matter what you do, it’s the right thing. You just have to trust me.</blockquote>
From Brianna Boehne:

</div>
<div style="display:inline !important;">
<blockquote>A reflection on voting: It’s a room full of old people. And then there’s me.</blockquote>
From Bill Haduch's "Science Fair Success Secrets":

</div>
<div style="display:inline !important;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>If it happens, it must be possible.</li>
	<li>If the temperature today is zero, and the weatherman says it’s going to be twice as cold tomorrow, what’s the temperature going to be tomorrow?</li>
	<li>If you don’t know what you’re doing, at least do it neatly.</li>
	<li>What if laughing gas really did?</li>
	<li>Would the world have been different if Einstein had owned a hairbrush?</li>
	<li>If you smell an odorless gas, leave the room immediately.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
From John Kingdon's "America The Unusual":

</div>
<div style="display:inline !important;">
<blockquote>Whether the majority is right or informed doesn’t matter; it’s the majority.</blockquote>
From Skocpol and Williams' "The Tea Party and the Remaking of American Conservatism":

</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">We” want our… government to speak for “us,” not cater inappropriately to “them.</div></blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">From Adam Gopnik's "Decline, Fall, Rinse, Repeat":</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">Annoying liberals is a pleasure worth paying for.</div></blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">From Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators.</div></blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">From Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">The people you want to talk to are the high school seniors … who have seen people visibly less qualified … get into prestigious institutions where they are rejected. If you think that is not creating resentment, you are wrong.</div></blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">From Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.</div></blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">From Kazzymodus, a poster on Facepunch:</div>
<div style="display:inline !important;"></div>
<blockquote>
<div style="display:inline !important;">Rudolph the red nosed reindeer,
had a very shiny nose,

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just as a warning: these are mostly here for my own recollection.

<strong>Sea Sleep</strong>

I strike out into the water, unconcerned with its temperature or the light nonexistent in the blackness swallowing the night.

The clothes melt away like sugar in the flowing waves, wisting downstream and washing over the fish, the rocks, the seaweed.

The future looms large over me; the eventual is coming.

I paddle and stroke to a spot far away from shore, so far away that I can only see a distant glimpse of the land I have left. It appears blurry, as if it were vanishing from my memory.

With naught to defend myself, I stop struggling against the efforts of the sea to carry me with it. The currents grab and pull me in a thousand different directions as I fly away from home, the home I once knew.

For that home is gone, now, absorbed into a subconscious a philosopher could not tap. The new home is the one I will make for myself, captured in the essence of my now-free existence.

I lay back and relax. The sea has stopped, I’ve stopped, my life has stopped advancing. Content, I lay back on the invisible barrier of my soothed mind and sleep, sleeping until the universe deems me fit to reawaken.

I sleep a very long time.

<strong>The Maw</strong>

I watched him walk forth. He gazed around nervously with every step. Cautiously, he slowly advanced into the maw.

The maw had always been present. The maw had created evil, destroyed hope, and altered the course of events for our world.

But it was never the maw itself that destroyed; the souls of the people destroyed themselves. The series of events was never the same, but those seeking fame, glory, and riches had always come out empty-handed, then empty-minded, and eventually empty of all life.

But he walked into the center, not even skirting the outside edges searching for a weak spot. The maw welcomed him with the tendrils of the night, and he continued.

I followed him closer. I had never watched the entrance before, only the exits: the screaming cries of terror, the insane laughter, the shrieks of joy, the sobs of sorrow. Never the same. But his appearance and emotions were normal: cautious, nervous, but resolute in his path.

As he neared the middle, my lines of sight blurred. It looked as though heat was rising and distorting the air, even as the temperature dropped to freezing as I watched. He took the final step…

… and vanished. I waited.

Several minutes later, there was a brilliant burst of light. A beam of hope had shot from the maw. I watched his lifeless body rise above the ashes of the maw as rays of white were expelled from his being. The maw screamed, and fought back, summoning a massive cloud of black from its murky depths.

But it was too late. The rays were absolute in their path, and consumed the maw in its entirety. The visions became too bright to watch, and I closed my eyes, waiting for it to be over, waiting for the end.

The light subsided, and I ran to his body. It lay on the ground, arms across his stomach, hat askew. His face was drained of all color. But he had sacrificed his soul for the destruction of the maw, and so I kissed his cheek and lay next to him, waiting for the sun to rise upon the miracle.

<strong>No Future</strong>

The clasps were vanquished, and I was free; I was free of the hate and the love and the tyranny and the charity and the whole world.

Wings sprouted from my arms and I flew away, gliding over the cities, the countries, the worlds of people both calling me back and wishing my journey well.

The music blew down from heaven, and I tap-danced on the notes as they crossed my path, my ever-changing path. The future opened its doors, and I sailed through it, riding a stream of music, laughter, and cheers.

But the moment was gone. The door closed as I reached it, vanishing quickly before my eyes. The notes squealed, dropped like stones into bottomless pits, scratching their way through the air. The voices stopped; the yells started. Angry, demonic yells came from every corner, surrounding me with their ferocity.

The wings withered and died, leaving long, bloody scars in the flesh where they had manifested.

The shackles sprouted from the darkness now enveloping me, holding me down and dragging me back, back, back into the endless circle of a living hell, with only the scars as a reminder of what could have been, of what might have become.

<strong>Selflection</strong>

Having someone to go on an adventure with would make the journey worthwhile.

<strong>For</strong>

For elation, a smile.
For the memory, a tear.

For the smile, a hug.
For the tear, a tissue.

For the hug, a kiss.
For the tissue, the trash.

For the kiss, love.
For the trash,

<strong>Twilight tears</strong>

He stood at the crossroads, ready to make his move.

She had left him far behind, disappeared into the land of light, of joy. Her friends welcomed her with open arms, and she snuggled under them, laughing and playing.

He stood. His heart wanted to push his feet forward, toward her… his brain told him to step back, back into the lonely darkness.

His thoughts had been hurting him for a long time. She’s happier, he told himself, she doesn’t need me. His heart wanted to believe in the best of her… she loved me once.

Moments later, or perhaps hours, or weeks, his brain conquered, and he arose from his twilight to finally enter the black, never to return. After one step, a tear fell from his cheek. This wasn’t easy.

That tear hit the ground and stayed there, illuminating a patch of ground. A beam shone from the indeterminate sky, revealing a lone finger.

He took another step back. Four more tears fell, and created brilliant patches. An entire hand reached out to him, begging for forgiveness.

Could this be real? he wondered, as he bent over to examine the hand. It looked real, and acted real, and acted as if it wanted him. He stretched out his hand…

and before his mind could consciously grasp it, the hand snapped forward and yanked his wrist down, down into the ground as he was absorbed into the light. She had come back for him, and held on with a loving embrace as he cried tears of joy, crystallizing their journey for the whole world to see.

<strong>Paranoid</strong>

I wish she had been more for me, in my own head. She occupied my every thought, as I spent my days wishing we could be together, bonded by love.

No one else believed me. They thought I was mad. I always had this far-off expression in my face, a glazed look in the eyes, as I reminisced on our short time together.

I just need <em>more</em>. Something more to stimulate myself. Thinking isn’t enough anymore. There has to be some way to physically connect with her, something more meaningful than this self-piteous existence.

Maybe everyone else was right. Maybe I <em>am </em>going crazy.

I saw spirits, hallucinations of her, gliding down the halls of my brain, haunting my every moment. Could she be with me through every breath, past every heartbeat?

<em>Yes.</em>

Love for me, the feelings I shared with this ideal of a woman, wasn’t close by. It was lust, lust that was keeping me alive, keeping me sane, if this was indeed sanity.

Perhaps I was simply preconditioned to fail. Years of rejection forced me to draw within myself, turning a deaf ear to those only wanting to help. My memories of her served as my crutch, as I whimpered through my own personal hells.

It got to the point where I couldn’t communicate with the few real people I had left. They would try and be serious, I would exhale and ignore them. They would try and cheer me up, and I’d be reminded of my own thoughts and burst into tears.

There were <em>no emotions left.</em>

So here I am. This is my story. It’s a sad, desperate tale of one man without a purpose, wandering in search of something that only exists inside himself. Don’t make my mistakes. Don’t be someone like me. I’m forever committed… you still have a chance.

<strong>Last page</strong>

And as I open the book to the final page, I simply want to tear it out, throw it asunder, and scribble a new beginning in permanent ink.

For the old story is gone, and we will write our own, together.

<strong>Flying</strong>

I missed her, and she missed me, but not in the traditional sense.

Instead of simply being together physically, we had joined in spirit, our personalities synchronized as we flew through the atmosphere, unbound by any laws or rules. She pulled and I pushed and we turned, and this kept up for hours and days on end.

For a short while, however, she left. Vanished. We kept in contact, occasionally, but ultimately we had been separated, unable to fly.

When her other friends were able to connect with her, to skim the wake behind her trail in the earth, it was hard not to be jealous. They were hang-gliding, at best, but the want was there, the need was there.

When I found a note on my desk, whisked here by pure love and innocence, with only a heart and a “miss you” on it, it filled me with joy, and I flew even by myself… for I knew now that she was with me always.

<strong>"Dream Police" meet 1984</strong>

The Thought Police, they live inside of my head!
The Thought Police, they come to me in my bed!
The Thought Police, they’re coming to arrest me, oh no!

You know that talk is tight, but those rumors aren’t gone…
And when I fall asleep I don’t think I’ll survive Room 101… 101!

‘Cause he’s waiting for me,
he’s looking at me,
Every single night he’s driving me insane!
That man on the telescreen!

The Thought Police, they live inside of my head!
The Thought Police, they come to me in my bed!
The Thought Police, they’re coming to arrest me, oh no!

Well I can’t tell the truth, ‘cause they’re listening to me…
And when I look concerned, bet they’re spying on me, tonight, tonight!

‘Cause he’s waiting for me,
he’s looking at me,
Every single night he’s driving me insane!
That man on the telescreen!

I try to scheme, they’re wide awake, they won’t leave me alone…
They don’t get paid, but still the Party won’t leave me alone…
They spy on me, I try to hide, they won’t leave me alone…
O’Brien got me, he’s the judge and jury all in one!

‘Cause he’s waiting for me,
he’s looking at me,
Every single night he’s driving me insane!
That man on the telescreen!

The Thought Police, they live inside of my head!
The Thought Police, they come to me in my bed!
The Thought Police, they’re coming to arrest me, oh no!

<strong>The candle had gone out.</strong>

And all that was left was dripping wax, like falling tears, onto the once-serene carpet.

<strong>Final cross country race, and thoughts on the season</strong>

Today was the final race of the season for cross country. 14 runners and two coaches, loaded up in two vans, on a ride out to Fremont for the district race.

<em>Sail out, on a distant highway…</em>

On the boys’ side, we knew we weren’t going to make state. This was just a fact. We’re not competitive enough, this final race was (for most of us) the last cross country race we would run as high schoolers, and probably ever.

<em>And you wanna run, but somehow you just keep on stayin’…</em>

Fremont’s course is on a golf course just outside of Fremont proper. The course for the boys essentially consists of running the entire circuit 2.5 times (two entire loops, then the first part backwards into the finish). We walked the course as a team and then split off - the girls went to warm up, the guys relaxed.

<em>I see my Marianne walking away…</em>

We watched the girls take off, and caught them again on the final leg of the race. Jackie was in fifth or so, which was great! and Molly, one of our best runners in prior meets, was doing poor for herself… she was down around 22 when she passed us, and was losing ground. No idea what was wrong, but she was upset, and for good reason.

<em>Wish there was something I could say…</em>

So the boys are getting pumped up. Time to go. Last race. Ever. I set a friendly bet with Westoad and Dante, who, along with me, round out the bottom three spots on varsity. In past races we’ve been fairly close to each other, so we decide to reimburse whoever gets their score counted for team placement (since only the top 5 count). We do our strides and are ready to rock.

<em>I think I should be goin’, yeah…</em>

First corner comes up, and the bottom three ends up being Dante and Toad and I fairly quickly. We all understand that this is probably our end destination, about 20 minutes from now. No matter. Maintain pace, try and keep with the last couple runners that are behind the packs.

<em>I don’t care if I get behind…</em>

The first lap goes fairly well. I’ve decided in my own head that I need to run as hard as I can… nothing else matters anymore. This is for pride. There is a single Grand Island runner in front of me that I’m pretty sure I can catch, and I do on the first downhill. Things are going… fine. I’m in front of Dante and the Toad, and now the GI kid. Woo.

<em>I have climbed to the top of the company ladder…</em>

… but, in the fight to go big or go broke, I go broke. There are only two uphills in the entire course, and after the second one my vision is almost gone. For the first time in my entire athletic career, I pass out, briefly, at the top of the hill. I don’t think there’s anyone up there who sees me fall, and I don’t remember exactly what happened. I vaguely remember Westoad passing me (because Dante and Grand Island already had), and at some point I guess I got up and started running again.

<em>I closed my eyes and I slipped away…</em>

So I finish the race. My head’s only somewhat cleared before I hit the finish line. There is nobody in sight, I’m in dead last by a massive margin. I don’t see my time and I don’t ask - in fact I still don’t know what it is. I don’t need to know. It’s a huge disappointment, to want to charge for a personal record and instead fall flat on my face.

<em>And time doesn’t wait for me, it keep on flowing…</em>

I stumble back to camp, get some words from my dad, my coaches, and the few teammates who have noticed that something is at all wrong with me. I tell my coach, Bakewell, thanks for four years of cross country, and she is a little taken aback. Despite me berating the sport in general every chance I got, I still value my time here, running with everyone.

<em>You’ll forget about me after I’ve been gone…</em>

Jackie placed, so we stick around to watch her get her medal. Then I leave with my dad, taking his work van straight home instead of a school van. We’ve got enough of a journey home ahead of us.

<em>There’s a long road I gotta stay in time with…</em>

I’m sad and angry that my season, my running career with any semblance of competition, came to such a disappointing, terrible end. I set a personal record last week while sicker than I am now, on a course that’s hillier than this one, in wind that was stronger than it was today. I came in confident, ready, rearing to go, and got nothing.

<em>I’ve got to keep on chasing that dream, though I may never find it…</em>

At the same time, I’m happy that cross country is over. It was a labor, and it was never my favorite thing to do in the afternoons. Never again will I need to run five thousand kilometers, exhausting myself in the process, just, well, because. Tell Burke, or Kearney, or whoever to keep doing that.

<em>People living in competition…</em>

In the end, there’s nothing I can do anymore. Cross country is done, my season is done, and my last year of high school is one quarter of the way over. There’s nothing left but to be happy with what I accomplished, to be content with my influence, to be at rest with myself.

<em>All I want is to have my peace of mind…</em>

<strong>Coming to pass</strong>

The conquest was over, the enemies slain, the chalice returned. I took the fair maiden for my own, and we became one, and as she stared into my eyes I swore to her that we would live happily forever after.

But both her and I know that this will not come to pass. The darkness is just as fast as the light, omnipresent, waiting for the light to vanish. For as light requires energy, requires time and effort and money… darkness only requires ignorance and laziness. I swore when I took her hand that I would eradicate the darkness.

But both her and I know that this will not come to pass. You cannot remove the dark. It will always swirl around us, and our challenge is only to open our hearts, our minds, to the bright white light. We will forever defend ourselves from evil, from pain, from sickness, from death.

But both her and I know that this will not come to pass. All humans grow weary, and cannot hold an impenetrable barrier. Armor that once was glistening, gleaming silver is now a tarnished, cracked, mottled carcass. The rapier cannot deflect every incoming attack. No matter. We will defend our honor to the last, and defy everyone.

Bu both her and I know that this will not come to pass. We will fall victim to terror, and quake in our shoes; we will suffer physical pain, and whimper in our beds. But we will never stop ourselves from each other, for the only truth is the truth that we will build, constructing it brick by brick every day from our experiences together.

And both her and I know that this will come to pass.

<strong>The edge</strong>

We clasped our hands together, my right in her left, and we jumped over the edge.

The fall was long, and even the stars couldn’t keep up as we descended into the thick black world below us. Time seemed to slow down and falter as even the pinpoint of light from the edge faded. We stayed in contact, never letting go.

The journey took minutes, then hours, then days passed. We had taken turns sleeping, the other holding on, keeping them from floating away. We had started out talking, but eventually had run out of things to say, and had instead drifted closer, holding each other in our arms.

Though we had long since stopped caring about where we were, a lone thread of light unraveled itself from the darkness, miles and miles below us. We couldn’t see each other, but we could see the brilliance below us, and we shed a tear of joy.

As we approached the speck, it grew larger, into a bigger and bigger disk of warmth. The only concern now was surviving the eventual fall. We didn’t beg, we didn’t pray, we only grasped each other more tightly, fanning our arms and legs wider, trying to push against the closing gap between us and the end.

But our destiny had already ensnared us, and we started to float, even glide downward. I saw her face for the first time in quite a long time, and kissed her, and only broke off when I heard the rumbling below.

Our destination had decided to welcome us, allowing us to plant our feet on the golden cloud. Birds flew overhead, and the rumbling faded away as a river slid between hilltops just out of sight. This jump, the legendary fall, and all the mystery surrounding it was laid to waste, and all the magic of our love would continue forever after.

<strong>Top Jimmy</strong>

I saw him walking down the street, earbuds stuck in his ears. There was snow on the ground and the temperature was low, so his heavy coat was zipped up, the hood bouncing off his ears.

<em>The guitar began to play, and the drumbeat yelled their introductions.</em>

He looked almost suave in his coat as he continued on his path. Some kid threw a snowball at his feet, almost by accident, and he barely flicked his head in the kid’s direction. That small movement alone was enough to send him scampering.

<em>They don’t remember the place, but they remember the face, and now everybody wanna go!</em>

His eyebrows furrowed as he dug his hands further down into his pockets. The wind had picked up, and I saw it seep through his ungloved hands as he gave a little shiver.

<em>Yeah the joint be jumping when the band be pumping, and you know they play a crazy gig!</em>

His head huddled down into his coat, catching more of his hood on his ears to warm them. The shade gave way to the brilliant sunshine, reflecting off the snow through the neighborhood, and he turned the corner, off to a new place, a new journey. I admired him already.

<em>Top Jimmy, he’s the king!</em>

<strong>The fog</strong>

As the flashlight pierced the fog, what he was looking for only slunk farther and farther away. The beam could only travel so far.

He dropped it and started running.

As his feet pounded the ground, getting more and more lost, his destination approached. Not what he was looking for, but the end of his attempts.

He stopped and kneeled in the dirt.

The darkness got darker and his mind grew insane. Blackness swept into his soul. Hope extinguished, the flashlight, and the sun, gone without a trace.

He wept, never to know the fate of his other, the last person he had left.

<strong>With Me</strong> (from <a href="http://quietplacescomic.com/">Quiet Places</a>)

“Now, I’m afraid,” the old man said, “I must draw your attention to the end of the world”.

He led them through another automatic door and into a large room. Metal desks covered in buttons and switches stood in rows along its length. Wires stretched from wall to ceiling. A few lights blink dimly.

And beyond a huge glass window, surrounded by stars, hung a burning planet.

The old man broke the silence.

“Death is no longer cold. Nor lonely.” He met their stares with a sad smile.

“Why did you save us?”

He looked back out at the swirling flames for a moment. “I didn’t.”

Minutes passed before the youngest asked, “Is this heaven?”

The old man chuckled, briefly, as though he had realised part way through that it was inappropriate.

“No, this isn’t heaven. You died, just like everybody else. Blinding light, roaring heat, and then you were nowhere. Or everywhere, if that’s what you’d rather believe.”

“So where are we?” The child stepped forward, carefully.

“With me.”

<strong>the most painful thing about growing up</strong> (from <a href="http://zaedilux.tumblr.com/">zaedilux</a>)

the most painful thing about growing up is realising that the heroes of your childhood are people too; that they’re flawed, more flawed than you could ever have imagined; that just because they are good teachers or parents or neighbours or friends or doctors or lawyers or cooks or writers doesn’t necessarily mean they are good people. when the rose-coloured shades of your childhood have been lifted and you’re ready to see the world for what it is, you realise that there very seldom is what they call unconditional love. the word <em><strong>love</strong></em> for all its intangibility is used over and over and over again and so carelessly and foolishly even though no one ever understands what it means, what it stands for, what it does and this is the terrible human condition that will make man weep forever and ever until death do they die. you start to learn that what people call love is actually want and need and lust for validation and security and acceptance and approval and every other pain-in-the-ass emotion you’ve been doctrined to believe you need to be human and you begin to see that no one ever truly loves you just the way you are because there is always expectation which mostly leads to disappointment and then resentment and then the inevitable dissipation of their affection for you which recedes in passing degrees until you are nothing but a carcass. your heroes lie when they tell you they love you and they’ll protect you and they’ll catch you when you fall and they’ll never ever let the men inside your head swallow you whole. they will grow old and bitter and tire of you because you’ve tired of worshipping them, because you see that they don’t really deserve to be up there on the pedestal, because they aren’t gods among men, because they aren’t good after all, because they really aren’t heroes. and what the hell do you with an epiphany like that?

<strong>Breezes</strong>

taking off, soaring away. hand in hand we rise above the streets, the rooftops, the clouds, the earth.

the heavens caress us in their gentle embrace and we squeeze back, grateful for the time we have.

nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky, they say. we’re going to fight that. immortality is just a state of mind, and when you’re flying you decide the rules.

I look into her eyes and the tears come: tears of happiness, tears of sorrow, tears of worry, tears of joy.

and she leaps into my arms and wraps me up so tight that there is nothing, nothing but her and i, together, for now, for ever. the tears stop, and the love spreads, leaves a track behind our path as we float on the breezes of space.

<strong>Summer</strong>

Summer started continuance,
summer ended deliverance.

Faces I may never view,
people never will be true.

Messages written, messages sent,
messages came and messages went.

The facts are out, the truth revealed,
the old ways of thought repealed.

Teardrops fall, sad songs play,
I think about it every day.

For when you left, the dog had fight,
but now he just stays up all night.

The signs all point to moving on,
but I just can’t believe you’re gone.

A beam of light from up on high…

… still I can’t bear to say good-bye.

<strong>Bombs</strong>

The bombs fell from the sky.

We watched them rain death as they only moved closer to us.

The crowd of people come in disbelief had nowhere to turn.

Many were praying. Some were crying. Some were screaming. Some couldn’t bear to look.

I turned to you and kissed you, kissed you like I should have done a long, long time ago.

“Why hadn’t you done this earlier?” you asked. “I never knew you felt this way!” And you kissed back, and we embraced, locked in lust and love, uncaring of our fates.

Only a moment later, death reached us. The explosions fell, the planes sped overhead as the payloads raced to the ground. Destruction of everyone, everything.

And when I woke up, you were next to me, holding my hand.

“You were crying in your sleep. Are you okay?”

I hesitated - then pulled you close, and held you gently in my arms until there was nothing in the world but us, together.

<strong>Cushions</strong>

He sat in his favorite chair.

Without warning, the cushions billowed around him and enveloped him.

Curiously, he was not suffocating. Merely warm and comfortable. A big hug, rather than a harsh grip.

He stretched his arms outward and caught another hand, briefly. He couldn’t see what was happening but he stretched further.

His hand broke free of the cushions. The cool breeze over his palm cooled him slightly. He groped about as best he could, looking for the other hand.

For several minutes he tried and tried, and was on the verge of giving up when a lone finger grazed his hand.

He slowly turned his hand, grabbed onto the finger and pulled it closer, clasping its fingers in his. They felt long, slim, feminine.

Familiar.

With a whoosh, the cushions retreated, and his love gazed into his eyes, her hand in his hand, standing next to him with a small grin on her face.

  <title>Inverting the stats on TF2 weapons</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/inverting-the-stats-on-tf2-weapons/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/hot_on_your_heels.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-52" alt="Hot_on_your_heels" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/hot_on_your_heels.png?w=300" width="180" height="180" /></a>Something that's always been a fun pipe dream is taking the generic blue and red text of a random weapon in Team Fortress 2 and flipping all the negatives to positives. Not all weapons work in this manner—some are overpowered or underpowered or just don't make sense. I'm going to attempt to collect the best of the best.

<strong>Force-a-Nature
</strong><i>50% slower firing speed
Firing pulls you and your target closer
20% fewer bullets per shot
10% damage bonus
66% increased clip size</i>

So with this, we've run into a shotgun that wastes nearly a full second in between successive shots, fires only 8 pellets per shot, and deals less damage overall (about 92 damage on a meatshot versus 105 for the stock), but loads ten shells at once and has a magical bullet vacuum effect. Such a weapon would promote staying power in a fight—ten shells is an awful lot—and even strategy as you try and summon only enemies you can kill without bringing them too close for comfort.

<strong>Baby Face's Blaster</strong><em></em>
<em>40% less accurate</em><em>
</em><em>On hit: removes boost
Run at half speed at maximum boost
30% damage increase
35% faster move speed
Boost builds on jump</em>

Okay. A difficult one to think about. You move 35% faster right off the bat. That's crazy fast. You also have a flat 30% damage increase, jacking a meatshot to 136 damage. You pay for this incredible increase in power and speed with horrid accuracy, though—meatshots are all you're going to get. Also, the more you jump, the slower you move, bringing you all the way down to just below Demoman speed—but you can remedy this by hitting enemies. It's just stupid enough to work.

<strong>Winger</strong><em></em>
<em>15% damage penalt</em>y
<em>60% increased clip size</em>

Surely too much. You're cutting damage down to twelve or thirteen versus the normal fifteen, and you're packing nineteen shots in a magazine now. Even with base damage at twelve, you're looking at a damage output of 228 damage versus the Pistol's hypothetically perfect 180. That's a bit of an increase.

<strong>Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol</strong><em></em>
<em>15 lower maximum health
</em><em>Doubles falling damage
</em><em>25% faster firing speed
</em><em>50% fire damage resistance</em>

Where the original Pocket Pistol increased a Scout's general survivability in exchange for slightly slower damage output and a lone weakness to Pyros, this version decreases a Scout's general survivability in exchange for slightly faster damage output (about .4 seconds faster for a full magazine) and a hardcore resistance to Pyros. Against some serious Pyro spam, this might be worth taking, but fifteen health is quite a bit.

<strong>Candy Cane</strong><em></em>
<em>On death: A small health pack is dropped
</em><em>25% explosive resistance on wearer</em>

This one is a simple switch, but it's certainly intriguing. Scouts, normally quick victims of direct rockets, Direct Hit rockets, and grenades, are now slightly more able to tiptoe through the spam. Hell, the health pack they drop on death can go just as easily to either team!

<strong>Atomizer</strong><em></em>
<em>Removes double jump
</em><em>30% faster firing speed
</em><em>20% damage increase against players</em>

This smells like an old Sandman, though don't ruin it in your head just with that connotation. A lack of double jumps means the crafty dodging Scout will lose his battles with rockets and spam, but will win more head-on melee contests or even initiate fights with melee—with 42 damage every .35 seconds, you're looking at 120 damage a second on this thing.

<strong>Direct Hit</strong><em></em>
<em>25% damage  penalty
80% slower projectile speed
Mini-crits grounded targets
70% increased explosion radius</em>

Sure, the rocket now travels at 220 Hammer units per second now—which for the record is slower than even a Heavy—and only deal 70ish damage on a direct hit, but that's ramped right back up to the default 90 damage on a mini-crit, and explosions are 70% larger. That's massive, for those of you keeping score at home. Truly a spam cannon, intended for strange crowd control and chunks of guaranteed damage, as mini-crits don't suffer from damage falloff.

<strong>Black Box</strong><em>
</em><em>On hit: Lose 15 health
25% increased clip size</em>

Straight and to the point. Trade five rockets for the need for a Medic up your behind. Good for Sentry pushes or encouraging risky Equalizer / Escape Plan play.

<strong>Liberty Launcher</strong><em></em>
<em>40% slower projectile speed
25% increased clip size</em>

With rockets that still outrun a Baby Face's Blaster Scout as the only penalty for such a large upside, this leans widely toward overpowered. It may even be a straight upgrade against Pyros trying to reflect the same projectile speed they've been used to for years.

<strong>Cow Mangler 5000</strong><em></em>
<em>50% fewer ammo carried
</em><em>10% damage increase
</em><em>5% faster reload time
</em><em>20% increased damage against buildings</em>

I tried to ignore some of the massive texts. I wasn't sure how to invert the alt-fire statistic reasonably and both the "No random crits" and "Cannot be crit boosted" lines simply vanish. Still. We wind up with a rocket launcher dealing 100 base damage (plus potential ramp-up) and reloading .15 seconds faster from empty. It also winds up dealing 119 damage to buildings on a direct hit, more than the Direct Hit itself does. Carrying only 8 rockets in reserve, however, kills most roaming possibilities, but makes this a defensive machine or a Payload wonder, depending on the team you're on.

<strong>Reserve Shooter</strong><em></em>
<em>15% slower weapon switch speed
</em><em>Mini-crits grounded targets for 3 seconds after switch
</em><em>50% increased clip size</em>

Shit, with nine bullets, you might as well use this as your primary weapon, and push the rocket launcher to a secondary for area denial. 15% isn't that much.

<strong>Pain Train
</strong><em>Wearer cannot capture points
10% bullet resistance on wearer</em>

Let's presume for a second that the bullet resistance only functions on maps with valid things  to be captured—Payload and Control Point and perhaps even CTF or Special Delivery—and we've got an interesting weapon. 10% again isn't much, but it adds up. It means that a Soldier can survive two Scattergun meatshots unhealed, though you won't see any last-second pushes from him.

<strong>Backburner</strong><em>
</em><em>Cannot be crit-boosted
</em><em>No random critical hits
50% reduced airblast cost</em>

In an attempt to revert the statistics of the Backburner, I didn't want to literally turn them around—in this case, I just inverted the  <em>idea</em> of them to try and come up with some weapon. You lose all critical ability, which potentially hampers you, but you get airblasts for only 20 ammunition consumed. Which is probably worth it 7 or 8 times out of ten. There still isn't a good airblast-only flamethrower, much to the chagrin of leafblower Pyros everywhere.<i>
</i>

<strong>Degreaser</strong><em>
65% slower weapon switch
25% burn damage increase
10% damage increase</em>

The opposite of weapon heckling, the new Degreaser Pyro takes more than one full second to switch weapons. He does however gain the ability to deal 75 damage through afterburn (7.5 damage per second), a nontrivial increase over the base 60, and deals 10% more damage overall. A piece of W+M1 work if ever there was one, and without even a gimped airblast this just increases the demand for a passive Pyro secondary weapon.

<strong>Powerjack</strong><em>
</em><em>75 health lost on kill
</em><em>20% melee damage resistance while active</em>

Don't kill things with it, just wield it in a firefight if you're concerned about a wild and crazy melee Demoman.

<strong>Back Scratcher</strong><em>
</em><em>25% damage penalty
</em><em>50% fewer health from health packs
</em><em>75% increased health from healers</em>

A Pyro walking around with this weapon is looking at 18, 44, and 88 health for small, medium, and large health packs. That's pretty major. It does, however, push pro-Medic gameplay incredibly high. A Quick-Fix Medic might not benefit much, but certainly any Medic trying to keep their team alive in battle will appreciate topping off a Pyro much more quickly, and the Pyro will appreciate his new tankier role too. An interesting idea.

<strong>Loch-N-Load</strong><em>
</em><em>20% damage penalty
</em><em>25% projectile speed penalty
</em><i>50% increased clip size
Grenades explode on surfaces
25% self-damage reduction</i>

Gliding grenades, dealing about 80 damage on a direct hit, but you've got six and they blow up when they hit the ground. This is essentially giving the Demoman a six-shot arcing rocket launcher. Which isn't all bad. With reduced self-damage and six shots, though, it would become awfully easy to maneuver without requiring skillful sticky jumping. Taking away the clip size bonus on a hypothetical new weapon might have merit.

<strong>Persian Persuader
</strong><em>50% decrease in shield recharge rate
All health collected becomes ammo</em>

Never run out of grenades again!

<strong>Natascha
</strong><em>On hit: 100% chance to speed up target
25% damage increase
30% faster spin up time</em>

Depending on how the stats are tweaked on this one, this could be interesting, particularly if you conveniently ignore the spin up increase (which was already broken to hell and back on the old versions of the Tomislav). Sure, you deal more damage, but if you're shooting an enemy around a corner, they've got a really good reason to run away from you. It shines in general play, sure, but if the speed increase were great enough it almost unintuitively would be better in open spaces rather than close quarters, where the Heavy normally dominates.

<strong>Brass Beast</strong><em>
</em><em>20% damage penalty
</em><em>50% faster spin up time
</em><em>60% increased move speed while deployed</em>

We've already talked to heck and back about move speed. More accurately, I've only mentioned it in the Natascha segment, but  again, let's ignore that for the consequence of a quick Heavy, speeding around when revved but with a damage decrease. Personally, I'm against increasing the speed of the Heavy in any way—and you can't tell me that the GRU aren't still competitively overpowered, even with the nerf. But if you kill his damage output, what is he but a stranger Pyro? It's a thought.

<strong>Tomislav</strong><em>
</em><em>10% slower spin up time
</em><em>Loud killer: Victims scream when hit and killed
</em><em>20% faster firing speed</em>

20% faster firing speed is nothing to sneeze at. And it only takes a 10% reduction in firing speed and a stat that really probably exists anyway. Still, firing speed increases is something that hasn't been toyed with on a minigun yet.

<strong>Huo-Long Heater</strong><em>
</em><em>Lights self on fire when deployed
</em><i>Ammo consumed at 1/6 the normal rate</i>

So glue yourself to a Medic, like many Heavies do, and just keep shooting. It doesn't benefit in a defensive situation and is actually just distracting, but if you can keep your health up, you never have to worry about ammo packs.

<strong>Family Business
</strong><em>33% clip size reduction
</em><em>15% damage increase</em>

A four-shot shotgun that can deal just over 100 damage at point-blank range, making it similar to a Scattergun. Honestly, this was the weapon that the Family Business should have been: it emphasizes risky burst damage, something a Heavy <em>must</em> be good at, in exchange for increased mobility, something the Heavy isn't very good at (minus the GRU and that has its own drawbacks). Perhaps my favorite reversed weapon.

<strong>Warrior's Spirit
</strong><em>30% damage decrease
</em><em>20 increased max health</em>

Straight upgrade. You would have to essentially remove the Heavy's melee slot for a max health upgrade to make any sense—although this wouldn't be a horrible idea at more competitive levels, where removing a Heavy's mobility or tanking abilities in the GRU or Fists of Steel is bad.

<strong>Fists of Steel
</strong><em>40% damage vulnerability to ranged sources while active
20% faster weapon switch speed
100% damage resistance to melee sources while active</em>

What a strange-o weapon this becomes. Invincibility in melee fights! Presumably this would not affect critical hits or would carry some similar modifier so as to continue to enable backstabs in particular. However, should you get in a melee fight, all it takes is a stray rocket (or the Scout that's chasing you to pull out his Scattergun again) for you to be a very dead Heavy. I really like this as a concept, though the weapon switch speed might benefit pulling out a Sandwich too much for its own good.

<strong>Eviction Notice
</strong><em>50% slower firing speed
</em><em>60% damage increase</em>

You're only swinging every 1.6 seconds. That's pretty huge. It's actually faster to switch weapons and swing again, if I have the math right. And you're dealing 104 damage on a swing, which is great if you land the first hit! but punishes your damage over time if you miss. Honestly I'm not entirely against this one either. With some tweaks (perhaps once you switch to the Eviction Notice, you can't switch weapons for some certain amount of time), this could be valid.

<strong>Jag</strong><em>
</em><em>30% slower construction rate
</em><em>25% damage increase</em>

Like the Southern Hospitality, but with an actual penalty! Underpowered and probably unnecessary, but lord knows there are plenty of deserving weapon models floating around, even for mediocre stat ideas.

<strong>Blutsauger</strong><em>
</em><em>On hit: -3 health
</em><em>2 additional health gained per second on wearer</em>

I hope you don't ever need to fight back.

<strong>Crusader's Crossbow
</strong><em>40% slower reload time
</em><em>Fires special bolts that heal teammates and deal damage based inversely on distance traveled
</em><i>May headshot
75% increased maximum primary ammo on user
</i>

An interesting alternative. Firing 40% more slowly is huge. Healing 150 damage at point-blank is reasonably interesting, though, especially if the crossbows ever got the Pyro's Flare Gun-style reload (where you can switch away during the reload). A quick Medic could then heal-heckle his teammates. Headshots would presumably just triple offensive damage and not reloading, though either would be somewhat interesting for a particularly twitchy Medic. As much as I don't want to encourage battle Medic-ing, it adds a layer of depth for healing and provides some risky but rewarding close-range combat options for the stranded Medic.

<strong>Overdose
</strong><em>10% damage increase
</em><em>Movement speed decreases when active, up to a 10% reduction</em>

11 damage a needle instead of 10, so 110 damage a second or so, up from 100. That's piddly. Almost as piddly as the default Overdose's damage penalty. The speed reduction really only ever serves to work against the Medic, too. Something more severe would have to be worked with for this to be reasonable: something like +30% damage but -5% or 10% movement speed.

<strong>Bushwacka
</strong><em>Mini-crits whenever it would normally crit
</em><em>20% fire resistance on wearer</em>

Minor downside for minor upside. Why the hell not.

<strong>Shahanshah</strong><em></em>
<em>25% damage increase when health is greater than 50% maximum
</em><em>25% damage decrease when health is less than 50% maximum</em>

So, like the Shahanshah now, except now you're more screwed in last-ditch situations and have a mild advantage in full-health Spy finds. Probably not a big deal.

<strong>L'Etranger</strong><em></em>
<em>15 less cloak on hit
</em><em>20% damage increase</em>

A competent Spy revolver was something that was attempted with the Enforcer, though the downside didn't match the upside. It still doesn't, really. This might better match it: sure, you can kill motherfuckers if you've got steady aim, but you will, not, escape. Not even the jankety Dead Ringer will save you. And that's something I think everyone can support.

<strong>Big Earner</strong>
<em>30% reduction in cloak on kill
</em><em>25 increased maximum health on wearer</em>

This one I kind of like, too. A Spy gains a bit more general-purpose health, to use at his leisure, but takes a serious hit to his cloak meter on kills. Were the detriment 30% of his <em>remaining</em> cloak be subtracted, it might be a bit more reasonable: with a full cloak meter, sure, you're still looking at a 30% reduction, but even with three-fourths of a bar you're looking at an end result of 53% of a cloak meter instead of 45%, and that number only gets better.

That's it! That's all I've got. The support classes in particular were difficult to invent ideas for just because of the nature of their weapons and roles. I do think that the reversed Baby Face's Blaster, Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol, Black Box, Cow Mangler, Pain Train, Backburner, Back Scratcher, Natascha, Family Business, Fists of Steel, Eviction Notice, Crusader's Crossbow, L'Etranger, and Big Earner are all very very deserving of some thought.

At the very least, if not the letter of the reversal, then the spirit.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A chronicle of our weekend trip to Avila University in Kansas City for CCSC, a computer science symposium with a programming contest!

<strong>4:00 am, Friday</strong>

Wake up. Shower. Grab all my stuff and head to the lobby to meet the other two guys I'm going with. Who are late. Way to go, guys!

<strong>4:30 am</strong><span style="line-height:13px;">
</span>

Walk out to my car, a ten-or-fifteen minute walk through a couple dark spots, and get on the road south, where we're picking up our professor at his house before we head down to Kansas City.

<strong>5:30 am</strong>

Reach his house after a couple confusing round-the-block turns (seriously, who puts one-way streets in a residential area?) and transfer to his car, with junk in the back and a heater that either doesn't work or he hasn't turned on. It's a little chilly. Everyone does a little bit of napping in between listening to public radio. All I remember is that they're trying to make $67000 in two days for some drive they're doing. What a load.

<strong>9:10 am</strong>

We finally arrive, just a few minutes late for the first presentation of the day. It's a three-hour tutorial workshop presentation on developing for Android phones and tablets using Eclipse. We didn't end up missing much in the way of talking, but having not already installed the Android SDK (which was apparently a two-hour-long download), there was no way to keep up with the coding. What I got out of the talk that developing for Android is a pain in the ass: every platform is really different except for four buttons, everything works slowly, testing is hard regardless of what devices you have in front of you, and there's a lot of cruft and auto-magically generated things that you're not supposed to touch but can still see. Oh, and a nap, when I accidentally fell asleep again.

<strong>12:00 pm</strong>

Lunch in the student cafeteria on campus. It's only about six bucks, cheaper than the dining halls back at UNL for non-students. I don't eat much—had too many donuts at the Android workshop, whoops!—but there's good food to be had. Chase goes through the line and gets asked, "Whatchoo want, white boy?" by the tall black man working behind the counter. I guess that's Missouri-style talk for, "Hi, you're not from here."

<strong>1:00 pm</strong>

An hour-long talk from a Rachel Hack (hah), the community liaison for Google on the Google Fiber project. This was fascinating. Google Fiber in a nutshell is gigabit-transmission speeds for internet. Upload <em>and</em> download. That's thousands of times faster than current broadband rates. And it's here, in select neighborhoods in Kansas City, expanding all the while. Their next target is Dallas, I believe, and I think this is possibly the biggest shift in how we consider the internet in years. Everything's already in the cloud, but we could have so much more.<em>
</em>

<strong>2:10 pm</strong>

A quick hour-or-so long talk in a classroom about word games, with a focus on programming and specifically programming in Python. It was clearly aimed at teachers for lower-level classes, as some of the basic ideas were built around "CS 1" and "CS 2" ideas. It's interesting and interactive, certainly, but perhaps a bit below (or above) our heads.

<strong>3:50 pm</strong>

Another talk about the support for parallel programming in C++. This is the most interesting thing all day. The first half is a talk about simple threading code in C++, which he was nice enough to hand out the code for on a flash drive. For simple C++ code, creating and running threads is nice and moderately easy: everything's a process and the syntax is always nearly the same. Something that's always seriously put me off about C++ is the lack of standardization in several parts: with the advent of C++11, a two-year-old update to a language, there are multiple compilers and they all have different behaviors in some situations. The guy is a fantastic speaker, though: he talks fast and clearly and confidently and is super knowledgeable about this topic, even engaging people during the break about memory allocation and other topics.

<strong>6:30 pm</strong>

Dinner time. We had a fantastic fancy dinner, with separated salad and dinner and dessert forks and everything. Mashed potatoes, rolls, steak, and cheesecake. Then a Ken Scribner, Vice President of some damn thing at Cerner. He was very real, down-to-earth, and had a heck of a lot to say on the transition in the business model from "client buys the software, buys the license, tries to maintain the database by itself, does the work, etc" to "client pays for our webservice and we do all the heavy lifting." He fielded questions from the audience and talked a lot of numbers in storage, a lot about security, a lot about the past and a lot about where students and professors should be moving in the field. The answer is still forward. Learn to learn. Computer science is so volatile that having a narrow skillset screws you sideways. He was great to hear.

<strong>9:00 pm</strong>

Checked into the hotel. Our professor got his own room and the three of us took the other. We drew cards for the two beds and I ended up by myself, hooray luck of the draw. Also, there's a wireless network somewhere near the hotel with the tag AsLan, which I thought was the funniest thing ever.

I was there when it was written." src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aslan.png?w=244" width="244" height="300" /></a>

<strong>6:30 am, Saturday</strong>

Wake up early again, though not quite as early this time. Shower and rustle the other guys awake. Tom ended up sleeping on the floor and didn't seem to mind, so everyone won. Head down to breakfast, which was free and pretty decent for hotel food, though I didn't partake in the donuts. I know better now. We get our stuff packed up and leave for campus.

<strong>8:30 am</strong>

With nothing much better to do, the three of us wander into a talk on the virtues of the Kinect, which instead of being particularly inspiring or exciting is just a series of tech demos with the Kinect box. I'm more interested in how Kinect augments a typical workflow, i.e. can you use gesture recognition to make mundane computing tasks faster and more efficient? He doesn't have any good answers and we leave.

<strong>9:30 am</strong>

…Nothing. We wander around campus for a bit and find one of the student lounges, where Tom and I promptly fall asleep on a couch while Chase works on homework. Eventually we wake up, play a couple games of pool, surf the internet more, and head back to the main building to meet up with everyone else.

<strong>1:00 pm</strong>

Lunch time. I'm hungry. We head back to the cafeteria and I discover what's been giving me an upset stomach the last day or so: the cafeteria pizza. It's nasty. Seriously. On the surface it's tasty but that only masks the hellfire that spawns in your stomach.

<strong>2:00 pm</strong>

Everyone gets their team login information and instructions on where to go for the competition, which is going to be starting late (go figure). One problem. We didn't get any information! A couple of questions reveal that our coach didn't look in the tiniest part of the website and shoot off an email to the correct person to signify that there was a team competing. Not that we'd all registered as student participants in the programming contest, or anything. Oh wait. We did. This eventually gets squared away, though, and we get our own cool spot in the database. Then the contest!

<strong>6:30 pm</strong>

As the final seconds of the competition tick away, we're only a couple lines from solving a couple of the problems. We've correctly submitted two of the five given, one more has an algorithm that is mysteriously wrong, and the one I'm on gives completely correct output…but for only one test case at a time. After some rushed time spent with the debugger, it turns out it was a misnamed variable in only one spot that was causing the error. We fix the error, quickly test it, and go to submit it, only to find out that time had <em>just</em> run out. With literally 30 seconds more, we were likely to have had one more correct problem. How frustrating. I threw my pen. And kicked a chair.

<strong>7:00 pm</strong>

The awards "banquet" with hot fresh Papa John's pizza. Great, more pizza! I avoid it like the plague, have a breadstick and some soda. We ended up getting eighth, the top of the teams that had solved two problems. Had we solved three, we potentially would have shot up to fourth or fifth, depending on the timing. Everyone claps for the winners and we get back in the car to drive home.

<strong>Later</strong>

Somewhere along the ride back, everyone kind of gets the same hankering for some shakes. We find a McDonald's (specifically a Rock and Roll McDonald's) and ask for shakes, only to find out that the only broken thing in the whole restaurant is the shake machine. Cool. So ice cream and a little food goes around, and we ride the rest of the way back to our professor's house. Quick bathroom break and we drive back home, through a thunderstorm (which was <em>cool</em>) and get home around 12:30.

What a ride. The presentations varied between vaguely interesting and downright fascinating, and we did pretty well at the contest despite some managerial problems.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night I had the most fantastic dream.

I was alone in a bay, a land with a small island just off the coast of a lush green tropical place.

I swam around the bay and periodically the largest waves I can imagine would wash around and pull me with them, and it was incredibly fun.

It was all fun and games until the tallest wave yet picked me up and tossed me into a shallow part of the bay, with rocks sticking out everywhere. Thankfully some water rushed back into the area while I was in midair, so I broke my fall somewhat.

It didn't hurt, but a couple minutes later I noticed something sticking out of my foot. I swam back to the island and sat on the grassy cliff edge, and pulled a full half-inch slice of rock out of the bottom of my right foot. It bled a little but still didn't hurt.

So I kept swimming, and I swam until I woke up. And when I woke up, it was about half an hour before my alarm was supposed to go off, except I'd forgotten to set it correctly the night before. So I set it, went back to bed, and woke up at the right time and everything.

It's only very recently that I've started remembering my dreams at all—minus a couple from when I was a little kid, the only things I've remembered from my dreams in years have been feelings, not events. Like "that dream was weird" or "gosh that was scary" or something.

I like nice dreams.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was the state level competition for the middle school and high school Science Olympiad! I volunteered (or was voluntold) to sign up to help judge an event, and ended up picking MagLev as the event to help with.

MagLev is a fairly difficult event. You have to build a magnetic vehicle that floats inside a metal magnetized track, and power it in some way so that it travels down the track in a decent amount of time. There's also a short magnetics test associated with it.

I'd been busy in the weeks leading up to the competition so I didn't really read into my emails and directions as much as I should have, and what ended up happening about a week prior when I sat down to figure everything out was that I wasn't prepared at all for the incredible amount of required things the judges were requested to provide. After a couple emails sent out, Mrs. Hester found some help in her husband and another fellow UNL student, with most of the materials accounted for.

Since MagLev is a high school-only event, I only had to be around for the afternoon, so on the advice of a friend of mine I headed out to the bus stop to get over to the other part of the campus to check in and get a free pizza lunch. It took a bit of waiting and a couple phone calls but I found out that the buses, well, don't run on the weekends. Cue me returning to my dorm, grabbing my keys, making the trek to my car, driving to East Campus, missing the turn, turning around, and again driving into campus to find a parking spot.

It was around this time that I composed a brief haiku about my experiences thus far.
<blockquote><em>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK fuck fuck.
Fuck fuck fuck, fuck fuck.</em></blockquote>
Ended up being on time anyway, even if I took a couple speed limits as suggestions instead of laws. Found the people I was supposed to meet, had some Valentino's pizza, and headed off to the event.

With a little bit of work, we got teams checking in their builds and the event got underway. We didn't mess up anything very major and everything went more smoothly than was expected, even the scoring, which was anticipated to take (literally) forever but ended up being a thirty-minute affair once we'd figured out a system.

Got the scores turned in and went to find some of the people I knew from Bellevue East, who were watching the Boomilever event (which they won, a lot). Madeline is making me put a shout-out to her here because she gave me a fair amount of grape Jolly Ranchers, which are the best Jolly Ranchers. Hi, Madeline.

After a bit more waiting around for the awards to start for the high schools (in between a little Brogue playing), the medals were passed out. Bellevue East took second, which was really good! even if the first-place team had wildly more points than they. Still a good accomplishment and a job well done.

Some of us walked back over to a different building to find the middle school awards ceremony, where my old school, Mission, took first for something like the ninth year running! They're heading to Daytona for nationals in a month! I got to say hi to my old coach, Melody Kjerstad, who is a really fantastic person and was super happy to see me and say hi!

After saying my hellos and goodbyes to everyone there, I walked back to my car and drove home—and apparently there's some kind of event going on at the Devaney Center tonight. The guy holding up the traffic into the parking lot where I normally park motioned for me to stop, so I rolled down my window. Before he could ask, I pointed at my parking permit sticker and said, "I'm not here for anything, just here to park."

He laughed, clapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Get out of here." What a nice guy. So I pulled in and walked back to the dorm.

What a heck of a day. I got my name in the fancy brochure as an Event Coordinator even if it was largely the work of both Hesters that got me there, and I got to say hi to a lot of people I haven't seen this year. With nothing  to do tonight and nowhere to be tomorrow morning, everything feels great!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bit.Trip Runner 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I'm Charles Martinet, and now it's time for Bit.Trip Presents…Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien!</em></p><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/runner-2-logo.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-66 aligncenter" alt="Runner-2-Logo" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/runner-2-logo.png?w=300" width="300" height="169" /></a></p><p>The title screen says this every time you start the game. For the uninformed, Charles Martinet is the voice of Mario and various other Nintendo characters (and is also the voice of <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/orvus.jpg">Orvus</a> from Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time, which is where I've heard his name before). It's not a high-pitched squeal, though, it's a deep, suave, clean, introduction, injected with a bit of clever humor. And it sets up the tone of the game perfectly.</p><p>Runner 2 is a sequel, clearly: it's the sequel to Bit.Trip Runner, the most successful entry in the Bit.Trip series of games, which prior to Runner 2 were 8-bit inspired rhythm games. The sequel has made the jump from an always-on retro feel to a full-fledged system of animation, which far from ruining the charm of the old games has only enhanced the quirky fun.</p><p>Even in a simple game like Runner, Runner 2 manages to improve on the formula from the first game. Actions in the first game were fairly simple: you could jump, slide, kick, block, and spring. There were various level mechanics through all the levels, but the method of dealing with them was the same.</p><p>In Runner 2, a very important extra mechanic is added: you can now "slide" at will, including while in midair. This opens up huge possibilities. Jump into narrow spaces, jump between enemies, grab gold whilst upright before ducking under obstacles and returning while still in midair to grab more gold. It adds a huge layer of depth without changing the Runner formula. There are also a couple of circular obstacles that can net points and occasionally other small rewards.</p><p>Oh, and you can dance for points. Dancing takes maybe a second to complete but leaves you defenseless. Score maximizers will get a kick of trying to find all the places they can get away with a dance or two, and casual players will think it's cute. Neither view is wrong.</p><p>In its leap to three dimensions, Runner 2 also added many more playable characters, each with different skins to unlock, most of which are well worth the effort. There's also "retro cartridges," which are much more cleverly hidden items that teleport you to an alternate retro universe for gold prizes (and a fantastic reward for the lucky person to collect them all). Each level can be completed on three different difficulties, and the difficulty you're playing on has no bearing on game progression—a welcome change from the first game. There is also a couple different levels of completion for every given level, where hitting a bonus bullseye after the level is completed nets you more points and game completion.</p><p>Runner 2 doesn't let anything get in the way of the fact that it's a game first and foremost. Some mechanics are ultimately pointless, like the new circular obstacles and dancing. They're just there for points, right? What's my motivation for getting the skins? Who cares?</p><p>I do. The game is intensely rewarding. Each of the five worlds has a secret character to unlock, various secret levels to visit, lock-and-key incentives to replay levels, a "rewards" system to augment the Steam achievements to keep notes on overall progress, and plenty of excitement even on more mundane levels.</p><p>Where Bit.Trip Runner was a tech demo, Runner 2 is a full-fledged game.</p><p>Let me justify that a little bit. Runner was a fine game. The game worked as advertised. Jump over obstacles in time with the beat, get through the levels, win the game. But let me follow that up by saying that I spent eight full hours on the first game, didn't beat it, and got to a point where even playing a level on Easy felt impossible because of my inability to time arrow clicks correctly. Seriously. One of the last levels is nigh impossible, and if you can't time about ten jumps and slides perfectly in one of the final tunnels, you lose the entire level.</p><p>But Runner 2 feels less biased against me at all steps. There are checkpoints halfway through every single level now, something that greatly speeds up the game and gives more incentive to try to explore a bit or simply collect all the gold without utter perfection. Even on the hardest difficulty, the game feels less about <em>timing</em> and more about the <em>correct</em> button press itself. Jumping in particular feels more fluid and being close enough visually suffices, which is more dramatic and more satisfying.</p><p>When I would play Guitar Hero at my friend's house years and years ago, I wasn't very good at playing on Hard, because that's the first difficulty where you have to move your fingers to the orange button, and it was very very difficult. But playing the harder songs on Medium was a lot of fun, because the myriad notes were challenging to hit in succession. Even when I got better, I had a lot more fun playing moderately fun songs with varied guitar parts rather than just blind quick-strumming parts (something like "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x28jaeyX2s">Ramblin' Man</a>" instead of the easy example "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jgrCKhxE1s">Through the Fire and Flames</a>").</p><p>That's what Runner 2 feels like. Medium+ mode. More buttons and requiring quicker reactions, maybe, but a challenging and rewarding experience.</p><p>Right now Runner 2 is fifteen dollars on Steam. Which isn't that much, at least not for someone like myself, who's gotten sixteen hours of fun from it so far and fully intends to finish the game to perfection. Not because I'm a completionist in particular, but because it's one of the most fun challenges in a game I've found in years. The soundtrack is beautiful: light and carefree in the first half of the game, progressing into heavier and deeper tones in the latter half.</p><p>I won't put any sort of "if you like rhythm games, you should" or "should you find yourself with extra cash and time, consider" tripe down here. I'll be moderately blunt. If you like having fun, and you do, pick this game up. You may consider using a controller to play, but it's entirely optional and the game works nearly identically with a keyboard.</p><p>Seriously. You can purchase the game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/218060/">here</a>. Don't be shy. You'll love it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/samuraijack.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-73" alt="samuraijack" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/samuraijack.jpg?w=240" width="240" height="300" /></a>Just yesterday a couple of my friends and I sat down to watch the first five or six episodes of Samurai Jack, an old Cartoon Network show that wasn't all that bad! Kind of on a whim, we came up with a fairly simple five-part drinking game, should any of us ever feel the need.</p><ol><li><span style="line-height:13px;">Take a drink whenever someone (usually Jack) unsheathes his sword and it makes a <em>shiiiiing</em> noise. The noise is crucial.</span></li><li>Take a drink whenever there is a close-up of Jack's face and his eyebrows are tense, with visible wrinkle lines.</li><li>Take a drink at the start of every slow motion sequence. For long sequences, you don't have to keep drinking. We're not advocating death.</li><li>Take a drink every time the screen splits to show multiple characters or actions. Hardcore mode: take a drink for every split.</li><li>Finish your drink every time something is reflected in Jack's sword. This one is rarer, but much much cooler.</li></ol><p>Remember, binge drinking is bad, kiddos.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>A Finals Week recap</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Monday.</strong> Gosh, I should study for the tests and things I have to do. Or at least do some work on the mostly-optional computer science work, which is due this week.

(runs off to play Poker Night 2)

<strong>Tuesday.</strong> Let's take a test over computer organization. Let's somehow screw up a single small part of one problem, proceed to misread the directions for the next, and thus completely stumble through about a third of the test, forfeiting the bonus points in the process. Oh, and let's stay up until three AM trying to finish the project that's due the next day.

(to his credit, Sam Adams didn't stay up until three, he stayed up all night, and it still didn't work—go figure.)

<strong>Wednesday.</strong> Let's take a test over matrix theory. A moderately easy class, right? Let's wake up early, shower and eat, then study all morning. Except let's have a viciously upset stomach because that always manages to happen during finals week. And let's manage to study all the wrong things. And let's see a term on the final that you've <em>never</em> seen before: what even <em>is</em> a kernel?

(It's the null space of a matrix, sure, I know that now, but that didn't stop me from bombing the test and securing a B+ in the class.)

Then let's finish up a presentation for computer organization, which you now know you've screwed up and still don't have a working demonstration. Let's write the demonstration. Let's revert to an old simple demo, seeing as all the new ones won't load or work correctly. Let's keep finding errors in the datapath…an hour before the presentation.

Then, when you're giving the presentation, let's have every possible thing go wrong: let's have the powerpoint file do strange things when converting between formats and cover up bullet points with images. Oh, and let's have the demonstration file corrupt itself, forcing a compile from scratch. And then let that program, which was working literally an hour ago, break and function incorrectly.

(but, get points for style.)

<strong>Thursday.</strong> Let's take a test over the history of rock and roll. Let's not do so great on it but still secure a 96% in the class. Let's also take a test over Unix, miss one question, and secure a 98% in the class. Cool.

Let's also write the report for computer organization, the process of writing of which is full of inside jokes and good music. Let's regret a lot about the class and the project. Let's not care, get it done early, and call it good. Even with a few bunches of screwy wiring.

With that, I'm done. No more judgements of knowledge, at least not for a few months. Good riddance.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>A lengthy discussion on randomizers, and why Tetris Worlds sucks</title>

From <a href="http://tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?t=512">this thread</a> over on <a href="http://tetrisconcept.net/forum/">tetrisconcept.net</a>, and most importantly from <a href="http://tetrisconcept.net/forum/showthread.html?t=512&amp;page=10">this page</a> onward for the casual observer.

To briefly sum up the discoveries: because of the incorrect usage of an OR operator in Tetris Worlds, the probabilities of certain pieces are <em>very</em> skewed away from the roughly 1/7 probability that ought to be guaranteed.

The T piece comes up 21% (more than a <em>fifth</em>) of the time, where the lowly L piece comes in at 9% (less than a <em>tenth</em>).

That's whack.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Six thirty Friday morning.</strong> Wake up, get packed, get dressed. Showered last night, so I don't shower in the morning. This becomes a problem later.

<strong>Seven Friday morning.</strong> Get in the car, drive to the airport. We park the truck and meet a rather talkative bus driver who makes fun of the couple sitting opposite us. To be fair, the guy was kind of a dork.

"Mothers. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em, costs too much to shoot 'em," says the driver. Good one, man.

<strong>Eight thirty Friday morning.</strong> Get through security, get on the plane. We're in the middle of the pack for boarding—this is a Southwest flight, so there's no assigned seating. My little brother, Eli, has never flown before, so he's a little rusty, and a little excited.

We take off, with the mandatory "ooh look out the windows" and the empty swallowing and the complementary bags with like four peanuts in them. We're seated next to a nice middle-aged man who seemed genuinely excited that we're going to a Tigers game—he's off to visit his family in New York.

<strong>Ten Friday morning.</strong> We land in Midway for a fairly short layover. Time for some lunch. Giant slices of pizza, Chicago-style, hit the spot. Also, we find out the hard way that playing Tetris on a tablet is much much less precise than playing with actual buttons. I don't recommend it.

<strong>Eleven Friday morning.</strong> Get on the next plane, this time Detroit-bound. It's less than an hour flight, which is very nice. Eli and I take our seats one spot behind the parents and lucky me! a nice-looking girl sits down next to me.

Being the master of conversation I am, I ask how she's doing, she gives me a one-word response ("Fine"), and then she sits on her phone until the bell sounds and then she curls up in her seat and falls asleep. Welp.

In all seriousness, though, it's a quick and easy flight, and the clouds let up once we're over Detroit, so we can actually see something from the air. It's quite a sight.

<strong>One Friday afternoon.</strong> We've changed time zones, hello, East Coast! and we've landed in Detroit. Some walking, some busing, some more walking and we're at the rental car place, where we pick some up kind of Chrysler and follow instructions to the hotel in Detroit proper.

Here's where I start losing track of specific times, but we find the hotel after the heavy three o'clock traffic rush (seriously, what the fuck is this?) and get ourselves situated before heading out again.

Our target is Slows, a barbecue joint that's very well known around Detroit: Adam Richman of Man Vs. Food actually stopped here once. I get The Yardbird, a chicken-and-mushroom-and-bacon-and-mustardy sauce masterpiece. And I have some of Eli's macaroni and cheese, which despite sounding silly is actually some of the best mac I've ever macked on.

After supper, it's a straight shot to Comerica Park, home of the Tigers. It's withing spitting distance of Ford Field, the home of the Lions, which is only a little jarring. If Joe Louis Arena was down the road you'd have the trifecta, but with the Red Wings game going on at the same time that might be a little much. (More on that later.)

The park itself is beautiful. There are giant tigers <em>everywhere.</em> Plenty have baseballs in their mouth. Others are just ferocious. The scoreboard is huge and has a giant LED Tigers logo that lights up in flames whenever a big play is made. Past the outfield, there's the skyscrapers of downtown Detroit. It's really a fantastic place.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/flaming-logo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-99" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/flaming-logo.jpg?w=830" width="830" height="288" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>three tigers, two lights, one scoreboard</em></p>
<strong>Six thirty Friday night.</strong> We're there. I'm cold as butts. I neglected to bring sleeves. We stop in to the Tigers merchandise store, where everything is overpriced and the points don't matter. The best deals are actually in the youth section, where the extra-large clothes fit me perfectly and are a fraction of the price. Got a cool long-sleeved T-shirt (with no help from the assistants) and stayed moderately warm through the game.

<strong>Seven Friday night.</strong> Game time. I won't give you a play-by-play, because you either care and already know it, or don't care. That and I'd probably get it wrong. The basic rundown: After giving up an early run or two, the Tigers rebound in dramatic fashion, with plenty of big hits and big plays, and shut the Indians down 10 to 4. Everyone's happy, except maybe the lone Indian fan behind us.

<strong>Ten Friday night.</strong> We get out of the stadium and make it back to the car, turn on the radio and hear that the Red Wings are up by one, then two! goals over the Ducks. This is great news! The Red Wings are tying the series!

Then the Ducks score twice in less than a minute to bring the game back to a 3-3 tie. Shit. Shit shit shit. We make it back to the hotel room and flip on the TV to find overtime started.

One minute and two seconds into overtime, the Red Wings score on a wicked outside shot. Game's over. We're going back to Anaheim on Sunday for the last game…of the quarterfinals. No one ever said this was easy. Everyone heads to bed. It's been a long day.

<strong>Eight thirty Saturday morning.</strong> I suppose I should get out of bed. Wander over to the hotel breakfast, which is perhaps the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. A muffin, some scrambled eggs, some potatoes, a bowl of cereal, and a cup of juice later, I head back to the room, where we're starting to plan our day.

<strong>Ten Saturday morning.</strong> We head out and grab a doughnut at Tim Horton's, something we don't have in Nebraska. It's pretty good. Tastes like a good doughnut. I can't complain.

Here again I lose track of times. We go to the GM Renaissance Center in Detroit proper, which has a lot of cool new cars in a basement showroom, including the officially-unannounced Sierra 2014. Which is super sexy, so sayeth my dad. The guy showing us around a bit, Tom, is very nice and very knowledgeable—he's been with the company for a good while and is proud of it.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/gm-renaissance-center.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-100" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/gm-renaissance-center.jpg?w=680" width="544" height="819" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>the Renaissance is a bit more recent than you last thought</em></p>
At some point we leave, in search of a good bite to eat. After quite a bit of driving around we wind up at a place called Hockeytown, just a stone's throw from Comerica Park and a shuttle ride away from Joe Louis, says the sign out front. They have a massive amount of hockey memorabilia on the walls and in the basement, and the door handles are metal Red Wings logos. That's class. I order a big Reuben and can't even finish it. Too much for breakfast.

<strong>One thirty Saturday afternoon.</strong> Ish. We go walking downtown to find Joe Louis' fist, which we discover is really more of his entire right arm. It's stranded on an island in the middle of traffic but we manage to get a couple dorky shots of it.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/joe-louis-fist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-103" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/joe-louis-fist.jpg?w=830" width="664" height="722" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>this is actually my arm, do not be fooled</em></p>
From there we head to the Hart Plaza, which has a nice view of the river and a few statues of its own, including one called Transcending that serves as a tribute to human labor. The best part is the circle of fantastic quotes just outside, including lines such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "The arc of history bends toward justice," the inspiration for the arcs.

There's also this statue on the grounds of the Municipal Center called the "Spirit of Detroit," an awing bronze statue.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-detroit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-105" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-detroit.jpg?w=830" width="664" height="574" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>you should also really see some of the <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-tigers.jpg">many</a> <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-red-wings.jpg">jerseys</a> <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-lions.jpg">it's</a> <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-pistons.jpg">seen</a> (with a <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/spirit-of-robocop.jpg">bonus</a>)</em></p>
We're starting to run up on game time. We drive and get the same spot we had the day before, a moderately cheap spot moderately close to the stadium.

<strong>Four thirty Saturday afternoon.</strong> Gates open at five. Frick. We sit on the sidewalk, get accosted by a homeless guy, move toward the stadium doors, get accosted by the same guy making his rounds. Welp. He doesn't have a blog, so who's the winner here?

<strong>Five Saturday afternoon.</strong> Gates open. We make it on through the gates, check out the store briefly, and then—get this—get to go down onto the field! Apparently some of the coaches and players are doing "stations" to talk about some of the stuff they work with. It's pretty crowded and the information is elementary, so we end up just taking a few pictures, including this one of me robbing some poor schmuck of a home run off the left field fence.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/home-run-leap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-101" alt="Home run leap" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/home-run-leap.jpg?w=830" width="664" height="567" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>also check <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/home-run-leap-for-real.jpg">here</a> for the bonus I-actually-have-a-ball-in-my-glove version</em></p>
This ends up attracting the attention of some security guy, who isn't very happy. <em>Oh well!</em>

<strong>Seven Saturday night.</strong> Game starts. Justin Verlander's on the mound. Here's where the brief game recap starts. Verlander doesn't do well, gets down early and lets plenty of runs in early. The Tiger bats can't keep up and the Indians take a sizeable lead. Both teams go through plenty of pitchers, and the Tigers even test out some pinch hitters and runners late in the game, but even a four-run rally in the seventh and a final run scored in the ninth can't stop a 7-6 Cleveland victory.

<strong>Ten thirty Saturday night.</strong> It's cold. It's a little wet. We head back to the car, drive home, and hit the hay. It's late. We lost. Good night.

<strong>Nine Sunday morning.</strong> Wake up and get some breakfast. Same deal as yesterday, lots of good food. We get back, Patty goes to a nearby church, there's some lounging around, and we get checked out of the hotel.

For some reason we didn't elect to get directions from a slightly more reliable source such as this laptop and instead elect to rely on my dad's smartphone. Which never seems to work out right, either he can't work it or it's slow, because it's a phone and not a computer. We don't even ask the ladies at the front desk for any help. We just leave.

<strong>Noon Sunday.</strong> There is talk of going to the Henry Ford museum, but it's a bit expensive and we don't quite have enough time. There is talk of going to a Carhart store, but the place my dad had in mind apparently doesn't exist on the Carhart website, which he's having trouble navigating on a five-inch screen anyway. We find a place just across the street from Slows, where we ate yesterday, to have lunch. They're very friendly and have burgers and hot dogs and sandwiches and milkshakes, and it's all a good meal.

<strong>Two Sunday afternoon.</strong> We've made it to the airport. With a flight leaving at three fifty, there's plenty of time for doing absolutely nothing. My favorite.

<strong>Eight Sunday night.</strong> Home sweet home. What a ride. What a fantastic time.

<strong>Some other notes from Detroit:</strong>
Six of the players on the Tigers starting roster have some stupid hip hop song as their entrance music when they come up to bat. Alex Avila has a rock and roll song, which is welcome. Victor Martinez has some kind of Spanish dance music, which is funny. And Prince Fielder has a choir singing "PRIIIIIIINCE," which is fantastic.

Almost every bus in Detroit and plenty of the signs have a giant "INJURED? Call (some number) for lawyer Joumana Kayrouz." What a gosh darn weird-ass name. And wow, her name is <em>everywhere</em>.

I'll just leave this post with a building wall painted with a giant robot dragon tiger.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This week's been kind of a busy one. After almost the entire month with nothing, this happens.

Early this week, in search of a job for the summer, my friend Shawnee pointed me to a YMCA job as a camp counselor for the summer. I was asked to come in and train pretty quickly, within the scope of a day, and started catching up with corny DVDs and lots of paperwork.

No later than the drive home was I called by a local Walmart, asking if I was interested in an overnight position. No thanks, mister, I've got a better job.

Get home and my dad's found me a full-time job at UNO, landscaping with a group of who he says are friendly guys, if I'm interested. I think, sure, depending on the hours the Y's going to give me.

Get another call from Walmart. From a different department in the same store, asking roughly the same question. No thanks.

Eventually talk to the Y and get some details nailed down and end up picking the landscaping job. There's more hours and I don't have to drive myself, which saves more money.

Walmart called me again yesterday, but the hell with that.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Taken from <a href="http://wastedonsteam.com/">this website</a>, which seems to work much better if you log in rather than trying to just do a search for a username.

All the games I've played more than 10 hours in:
<ol>
	<li>Team Fortress 2, with 2105 hours played. A decent chunk of that is raw idling hours. But I still think more than half is legitimate playtime. Which is insane.</li>
	<li>Dungeons of Dredmor, with 170 hours. One of the biggest time sinks ever. There is so much to do here, and so much I haven't even done.</li>
	<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, with 47 hours. For whatever reason, the site missed this one.</li>
	<li>Audiosurf, with 41 hours. This number rocks. Music rocks. Go buy this.</li>
	<li>Alien Swarm, with 29 hours played. I didn't actually realize I'd played this that much. Just goes to show you, free games with only one campaign can be fun too.</li>
	<li>Super Monday Night Combat, with 27 hours. It's my understanding that basically no one plays this game anymore. It was fun but was ultimately too finnicky and hard.</li>
	<li>Monday Night Combat, with 26 hours. Billed as TF2 with turrets, it was some weird combination of that and a more traditional third-person shooter. It worked reasonably well and I played it quite a bit for a while.</li>
	<li>The Binding of Isaac, with 24 hours. This game is hard hard hard and remains fun fun fun. I lost a bit of the spark to play this after a friend of mine got much much better at it than I ever did, and beat the game (or got really close). Hey Andy. Fuck you.</li>
	<li>Borderlands, with 23 hours. I think a few of those were lost to my computer overheating and slowing down, before I figured out what was wrong. Still a game that needed friends to finish.</li>
	<li>Portal 2, with 21 hours. Both campaigns were lots of fun and occasionally jumping into community puzzles is good fun too.</li>
	<li>Bit Trip Runner 2, with 19 hours. I'm going to beat this game. This number's going to go up.</li>
	<li>Fallout: New Vegas, with 17 hours. The world is just so big and it's easy to get lost in it.</li>
	<li>Cubemen, with 14 hours. A great relaxing game. I played most of the levels through, though.</li>
	<li>Bastion, with 13 hours. I keep meaning to go back and grab some of the endgame achievements, but it never happens. Still a fantastic work.</li>
	<li>Poker Night 2, with 12 hours. I'm going to unlock all of the items if it kills me. And it might.</li>
	<li>10,000,000, with 12 hours. This game was a really fun time waster, easy to pick up and put down.</li>
	<li>And Terraria, with 11 hours.</li>
</ol>

  <title>Returning to Jak and Daxter</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/daxter.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-170" alt="Daxter" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/daxter.png?w=205" width="205" height="300" /></a>I've owned Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, a PS2 game, for quite a while. Nearly since it came out. Which was 2001.

I beat the game a long time ago. I never did find all the power cells, but I got just enough to finish the final puzzles and beat the final boss. After that point, I didn't play the game much. It was a long, frustrating, whomp.

Coming back to this game now, having a bit more experience with the game and things under my belt, it's easy to recognize how fantastic this game really is. The genius lies in the difficulty, and the open world. There are no loading times. There are no levels. And you get three heart chunks. If you lose all three, you die. And respawn sometimes at the beginning of the area.

Jak has plenty of offensive moves he can use. Punches, uppercuts, spins, rolls, slams. Possibilities for aerial and ground combat. But you can't just mash buttons to win. The spin move is perhaps the safest move, but it has a relatively small range and takes a second to resolve after you're done spinning. The slam requires time to jump and leaves you open while you get back on your feet. The punch has a great range but thrusts you forward, potentially off cliffs and into trouble. So you have to plan every attack carefully, and pick off enemies one-by-one as best you can.

The four main types of Eco, the mystical energy, require a mastery as well. Green Eco preserves your health, but you need fifty of the little chunks to get one slice of health back. Given that enemies and boxes only drop two to four, you need to be awake or you'll miss out. You can also collect an extra fifty at full health to essentially give you a fourth health slice, but this doesn't carry over if you happen to die, which rewards careful play. Blue Eco makes you move faster and lets you perform a wide variety of tasks, essentially becoming a "get-the-blue-stuff, find-the-door" task but with some variations. Red Eco grants all your attack more range and power, which is a lot of fun but doesn't remove the possibility of danger! because of the time between moves remaining present. And Yellow Eco lets you shoot enemies, which is great and removes danger at range, but is in the game only sparingly and often in close quarters.

Thus far I've collected most of the Power Cells for the sections I've gone through, which I think I maintained on my earlier save file but I'm approaching the more difficult parts of the game. I'm about to dive into the Precursor Basin and the Lost City before heading north to the Lava Pits, which is essentially the final hub for the game.

This game is really fantastic and I'm glad I came back to it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Thomas Was Alone review</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/thomas.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-181" alt="thomas" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/thomas.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Thomas Was Alone is a very simple game. You begin the game as Thomas, a nondescript red rectangle, with the goal of reaching the end of the level.

Once you start getting further into the game, though, the atmosphere changes. Thomas isn't alone. Thomas is a computer AI, let loose in some simulation, the story of which is told briefly through quotes of humans on the outside, the programmers and design leads and other vaguely important people.

The game itself plays like any other minimalist platformer, with solid mechanics, constant innovation through the entire game, and clear level design. It also tosses in a little bit of Bastion (or perhaps LittleBigPlanet), where each character's thoughts are narrated by Danny Wallace in a well-done infusion of personality.

The soundtrack works like the rest of the game, lending tension to tense moments and soothing to calm moments. It flows well with the other elements of the game.

Ultimately a relatively easy and short ride. I have four hours logged and all the achievements, most of which are simply finding the secret squares in various levels, and the others which will be found simply through playing the game. But it's not just about being an epic journey, it's about having fun, and I certainly did.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Beginning of the Ender</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-beginning-of-the-ender/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ender.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-178" alt="ender" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ender.jpg?w=200" width="200" height="300" /></a>Just today I finished reading <em>Ender's Shadow</em>, the companion novel to the original <em>Ender's Game</em> book.

<em>Ender's Game</em> is in my top five favorite books of all time. It is both a self-contained complete experience and a grand invitation to an expanded universe of sequels and prequels. In a sense, it is the perfect book for an author to begin his series with: easy to pick up for a general reader, inviting for the particularly experienced.

I've had a paper copy of <em>Ender's Game</em> for quite a while and it was just within the last year that I went looking for more novels in the series. Both <em>Shadow</em> and the third part in the main series, <em>Xenocide</em>, were at the local book store, and with some time to kill in between working a job and getting a ride home, I decided to pick up reading again.

It's incredible, the parallels between the two novels. Ender, the namesake of the series, is a genius, a natural-born leader. Bean, the star of the <em>Shadow</em> parallel series, is perhaps the smartest person on the planet, but too analytic to be the best commander and too small to be taken seriously. Both books deal somewhat with the politics of an Earth at war in space, with alliances and rivalries, and with manipulating minds and maintaining control so as to be an effective leader and listener.

These are the kinds of things that make a man think. Why can't <em>I</em> lead well, or take charge, or be brilliant and absorb information? What's stopping <em>me</em>?

Well, first and foremost, it's only a book. I know that. That's easy. But understanding the concepts behind the book only makes me respect it more and more, and myself less and less.

Regardless. If you haven't, go read <em>Ender's Game</em>, and if you liked it, <em>Ender's Shadow</em> serves as a fantastic spin on the same story arc. The other novels in the main series, <em>Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide, </em>and <em>Children Of The Mind</em> are slower-paced and more thoughtful—in fact I only got through the first two back when I was on my big reading kick toward the end of middle school, and I didn't absorb them particularly well. But I'm going to revisit them, and there's plenty of great reading to be had.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Chuck Palahniuk's "Survivor" quotes</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I just finished re-reading this book (which is a fantastic satire on the general media and also a very curious look at life and suicide and death) and decided to pick apart my sticky note bookmark to keep track of the best quotes. They're all near the end of the book, but I don't think they spoil much, if anything.

"And if you never have sex," [he's] saying, "you never gain a sense of power. You never gain a voice or an identity of your own. Sex is the act that separates us from our parents. Children from adults. It's by having sex that adolescents first rebel."

And if you never have sex, [he] tells me, you never grow beyond everything else your parents taught you. If you never break the rule against sex, you won't break any other rule.

<strong>-----</strong>

"You know, the horizontal bop. Hide the salami. The hot thing. The big O. Getting lucky. Going all the way. Hitting a home run. Scoring big-time. Laying pipe. Plowing a field. Stuffing the muff. Doing the big dirty."

<strong>-----</strong>

Here are condoms lined with a topical anesthetic for prolonged action. What a paradox. You don't feel a thing, but you can fuck for hours.

This really seems to miss the point.

I want my whole life lined with a topical anesthetic.

<strong>-----</strong>

"Long-term," she says, "we're all going to die. Then our bodies will rot. No surprise there. Short-term, we're going to live happily ever after.

Really?

"Really," she says. "So don't sweat it."

…

[She] says, "Can you just relax and let things happen?"

I ask, does she mean, like disasters, like pain, like misery? Can I just let all that happen?

"And Joy," she says, "and Serenity, and Happiness, and Contentment."

…

"You don't have to control everything," she says. "You can't control everything."

…

"If you worry about disaster all the time, that's what you're going to get."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The NCAA's redefined "Kenny Bell" rule</title>

Essentially, the definition of a defenseless player has been widened to add "a player who receives a blind-side block."

I won't beat this point into the ground, but this is entirely silly. The more stupid rules they add to football the less I want to watch it.

Instead, I'm going to watch this over and over again:

It took me quite a bit of playing to realize that upgrading units is (for the most part) a sham, and the decreased effectiveness of the Flints and freeze guns meant that a Grill/Moty combination sets up almost every single map perfectly.

So I wrote a guide and what have you. This game could always use a little more attention.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/man-of-steel.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-201" alt="man of steel" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/man-of-steel.jpg?w=682" width="415" height="621" /></a>Went and saw Man of Steel today. I liked it. But let me back up a little bit.

Of all the superheroes, I've always liked Superman the best. I never had a good reason. I never saw the old movies, and I never read the comics. I just thought he was cool. A survivor of Krypton, come to Earth. With the most basic of superpowers: flight, strength, and heat vision, because heat vision. Cool, right?

In the last year I've seen (in this order) the Avengers, Iron Man 3, and Iron Man. Before this year, whenever they came out, I saw the first two Maguire Spider-Man films. Those five and Man of Steel entirely comprise my first-hand experiences of superhero movies, and indeed superheros in general. I never got into comics. I don't own any of the games, and I never watched the TV shows. So that's all.

Tobey Maguire's kind of a doofus. This is almost incontrovertible. But those movies were entertaining to watch, even if the villains were entirely more fun to observe. I was much younger when I saw Spider-Man 2 but Doctor Octopus gave me nightmares. Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina still blow me away. But the third movie wasn't reviewed well at all, and I didn't have enough interest in the reboot so soon after.

The Avengers was a good…superhero movie. It has a bunch of superheroes. They fight the evil aliens. There's explosions. The funny parts are funny, the serious parts are serious, the dramatic parts are (pretty) dramatic, and everyone performs well. Is it a breakthrough in cinema? No, it's just a really good action super-movie. It was enjoyable. Cool beans.

Iron Man 3 (which I saw before the first two, I know, yadda yadda) was not that fun to watch. It was too cornball, too silly, too forgettable. There's the creepy alien dudes with the super-hot blood. And the (mild spoiler) fight at the end with all the Iron Mans. Whoop.

I'd heard from my friends that the first Iron Man was better. So I watched it. And didn't like it any better. I saw most of the physical humor coming a mile away, and I didn't care for the plotline, really. Tony Stark is such a dick that I have trouble believing in him as a superhero. That and his only superpower is having a lot of money, and being smart. But he wants to stop the terrorists!!! So he's a good guy!!! I just didn't like it very much. I don't feel a need to complete the trilogy, and if there are any more movies in the same vein I might stay away altogether.

(just as a side note, a specific part in Iron Man that kills it for me, and this does have a spoiler of the ending: when Tony Stark is building the Iron Man suit he straps on his leg thrusters and says something like "We're going to try the rockets at 1% capacity," which comes right before he is comically thrown backward into a wall by a huge burst. So he messed up somewhere. Sure. At the end of the movie, when he flies the Iron-er Man into space to freeze him, his own suit, being powered by a shittier reactor, is at something like 2% power. But Iron Man survives because his suit has "emergency backup power," because of couuuuurse it does. This scene doesn't even matter in the end, because neither being low on power nor being frozen actually impacts the final fight. It's silly.)

Back to Man of Steel, while it's fresh in my mind. The movie is not the smartest, most fantastic piece of work ever. I know this. Even my threadbare knowledge of the comic book world confirmed that certain pieces of the plot were straight wrong versus the original storyline. Perhaps the most egregious is (spoiler-free) the role that Lois Lane plays in the movie, and particularly her knowledge of things that she ought not to know of.

But. Despite all that, it was <em>enjoyable</em>. The fight scenes were fun to watch. Sure, Superman is completely wrecking Metropolis and Smallville to do it. But damnit if it isn't really satisfying to see trains being thrown around and people being dragged through buildings, justifiable because they're <em>super</em>. The interactions between the bad guys and the military and Superman are interesting, even if occasionally long-winded or overdone.

There are a few types of superheroes. The rich/smart ones, like Batman, and Iron Man. The superheroes that <em>could</em> exist, if only the technology on <em>our world</em> was more advanced. The alien ones, like Green Lantern and Superman. The superheroes that <em>could</em> exist, if only we could find life on other planets. And the other ones with magical or other powers (where the first example that pops into my head is Dr. Strange), who really <em>couldn't</em> exist based on current logical thinking but can serve in their own right.

I haven't seen the Dark Knight trilogy, and it's supposed to be really good. But I worry that I'm just not cut out for the superhero that isn't, for the superhero in name only, for the man who does well because he simply has money, or brains, and is not elevated above our wildest dreams, like the Superman.

Sure, Superman's fights all basically come down to punching the bad guy until he dies. But I enjoyed Man of Steel, and I enjoy Superman, more than every other comic book hero.

So sue me.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>A reaction to the Game Grumps actions.</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/grumps.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-206" alt="grumps" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/grumps.jpg" width="350" height="350" /></a>I wouldn't consider myself hip to much of the YouTube, "Let's Play" world. I don't care for a lot of the shit on the tubes. It's stupid and in the case of YouTube can suck up a lot of time without actually accomplishing anything. So for a long time I didn't play the subscriber game, didn't follow any channels, didn't fall in love with any internet celebrities. Things were simpler back then.

I don't actually remember how I got introduced to the Game Grumps. Perhaps it was a cross-link from something related to Egoraptor, whose animation I was introduced to with Metal Gear Awesome, one of the most hilarious videos of my childhood. (And even still.) JonTron, his cohost, was somebody I hadn't gotten too much into. (And in all fairness, I still haven't gone back to very much of his own videos.)

But the Game Grumps was <em>funny.</em> Above all else. Arin was the straight man, determined to complain. Jon was the loud slightly-overweight funny guy. When Arin was happy, it was a great time, because it was so rare. That's why he's Grump. When Jon was happy, he sang or screamed or made up words. Which was often. Hence not-so-Grump.

Within the space of a day, three things happened: an announcement was made that Jon was leaving the show to focus on his own channel, which had been neglected for months. What he was really doing was a little up in the air.

Then a new Game Grumps came out, featuring a personality (Danny) who I don't know playing with Arin. I didn't mind him so much but he is definitely as smart or smarter than Arin and is also a straight guy. How he'll fit into the Grump show is anyone's guess. His entrance was neutral.

Then a new show under the Game Grumps channel, Steam Train, came out, where Danny (same dude) and someone else whose name I am already forgetting (Eric? Shit I don't know) pledge to play PC games new and old. They opened with Hotline Miami, a really fun game, but they open by <em>playing it with a controller</em>, which kind of defeats the purpose. Sure, a controller works fine for some Steam games, but <em>Hotline Miami???</em> That's a silly move. That and their first episode wasn't very strong.

Coming in later, the internet finds out that <em>apparently</em> Jon is moving and <em>may potentially</em> have had a bit of a falling out with Arin. Who really knows the truth. The show will no doubt be weaker with Jon gone and I think every single person knows it. It might continue on and be something good in its own right, but what we had was a lot of fun.

Recognizing an opportunity (and having wanted to do this for a while), a friend of mine and I ordered "HEY I'M GRUMP", "I'M NOT SO GRUMP" shirts, still featuring the (now slightly outdated) Arin and the (now apparently entirely obselete) Jon cartoon heads.

We'll see if Danny or the Steam Train pan out, but for now, thanks, Game Grumps, for many a laugh.]]></content:encoded>

A man tries to get veterans' assistance for spraining his ankle and Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois won't take any of his crap.

  <title>Necessities for twin-stick shooters.</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/necessities-for-twin-stick-shooters/</link>
  <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 22:30:06 +0000</pubDate>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/robotron.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-224" alt="robotron" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/robotron.gif?w=300" width="300" height="105" /></a></em>Just recently I've rekindled an interest in twin-stick shooters. The type of game where you, the player, flies around in a 2-D plane, moving around with one joystick and shooting mans with the other. <em>Robotron 2084</em> was an early example of this, and it's still fun 20-some years later. But not all twin-stickers are the same, and in my vague quest to pick some more up on Steam I've narrowed down a few things that new games of this genre really ought to have.

<strong>Temporary and permanent rewards.</strong> This is crucial for such a simple game. Temporary rewards either last for a limited amount of time or until you die. Permanent rewards last throughout all of your lives, or until the end of the level, whichever comes first. Temporary rewards can include score multipliers, boosted abilities (like more firepower or speed), or other short-lasting advantages. Permanent rewards can <em>also</em> include score multipliers (though this is pretty empty), or other things like upgrading your ship to be stronger for the rest of the play, or even out-of-game rewards like new ships to fly or new levels to play.

<strong>Competing for score and competing for game progression.</strong> Sure, a game where the entire point is getting a high score can be fun for a while, and some people will string it out and make it a temporary career. That's fine. But there is a lot of pleasure in some overarching goal. As mentioned above, permanent rewards are a lot of fun, and the more tangible the reward, the more a player will strive toward it. Give every ship fifty new paint jobs if you like, forty of which can be earned or found simply through playing the game, the last ten of which require some incredible feats in the different modes. Proud display of skill.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hexodius.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-218" alt="Hexodius" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hexodius.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="164" /></a>Even the act of unlocking further levels to challenge is game progression, however basic. But allowing the player to compete for a high score in whichever levels would be appropriate (which can be challenging depending on the game structure, <em>Hexodius</em> is a good example where high scores don't work well) is also fun. Challenge your friends, if you have friends who play. Challenge the internet. Challenge perhaps only people from your state or region, and then take that to the world stage if you're good enough. Give the player bronze/silver/gold medals depending on what percentage they're in. Knock them down if it's been too long since playing. Keep them coming back.

<strong>Easily distinguished friendly/enemy bullets.</strong> Moving more to the technical aspects of a game, if I don't know what I'm shooting at, I'm going to be frustrated quickly. This is something that <em>Beat Hazard</em> messes up royally. I can't count how many times I died in the demo and couldn't tell where the shot had come from. Whether this is something as simple as "the player shoot green, the enemies shoot red" or something more complicated where "the player shoots thin, fast-moving shots, the enemies shoot round, slower shots," the obviousness of every bullet on screen must be apparent.

<strong>Airtight controls.</strong> I shouldn't really have to mention this. First thing I noticed about <em>Hexodius</em> was that controlling the ship was a little jumpy at times. At first I thought my controller was on the fritz. It turns out that pointing either the move or fire joystick directly southwest would cause no input to be read. With every single other game working perfectly, I could only conclude it was a problem with the game. And that broke the game. That is very near a cardinal direction, and I can't shoot there. It was the cause of many deaths. More generically, default move speed should be comfortable, not too slow or fast, and bullets should fly faster than the default ship speed at all times.

<strong><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/beat-hazard.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-219" alt="beat hazard" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/beat-hazard.png?w=300" width="300" height="124" /></a>Balance.</strong> This does not apply to every twin-stick shooter, and I know it. But I felt the need to bring it up, as it's very important. If you offer the player multiple ways to shoot enemies and present them as equal, they really truly ought to be equal. Special weapons that take time to recharge or must be found are an exception, of course, but all the player's normal, default tools should be even. <em>Super Stardust HD</em> is an egregious example of how not to do it. The player's Gold Melter, because of the way the weapon behaves (firing in a continuous stream), makes it the superior choice over the Rock Crusher and Ice Splitter simply because it pushes every obstacle away, a crucial tactic in the game, even though the three are supposed to be used <em>roughly</em> evenly because of the existence of three separate types of asteroids. This is silly, and removes all strategy and thought.

<em><strong>Preferably</strong></em><strong> more enemies instead of stronger enemies.</strong> This is the point where things start getting a little more subjective. There is nothing wrong with enemies taking a few hits, and boss monsters are absolutely acceptable. But the presence of a few strong monsters, who can all shoot at you but only from a fixed point, <em>tends</em> to make the game a "hover your gun over the first bad guy until he dies, move on" snorefest. On the contrary, a swarm of enemies who take exactly three hits from your primary machine gun weapon turns the game into a challenging joystick swivelfest, where you want to focus on each individual enemy exactly the right amount of time so as to move on to the next enemy quickly. That, and it's usually more satisfying to utterly obliterate a screen-covering swarm of bugs rather than a couple of queen bees. Though perhaps that's just me.

<em><strong>Preferably</strong></em><strong> lasting pick-ups.</strong> If I shoot an enemy and he drops a gun upgrade, but I'm in the middle of a firefight, I the player feel like I have earned a gun upgrade. Maybe I shot him from far away and am now confronted with a new wave of enemies at point-blank. Whatever the reason, if that power-up disappears in just a few seconds, I will either disregard it entirely and risk being outpaced by more and more enemies, or take the risk upfront to try and grab it, chancing a stupid death for a power-up. Timing out can be a solid game mechanic if used right, sure, particularly if there are a lot of things to snatch and merely grabbing a majority of the spoils will keep you in the game. But cheating the player into risky situations if he does not make every decisive play is troubling.

<em><strong><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/waves.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-221" alt="waves" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/waves.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="140" /></a>Not</strong></em><strong> a quick-time combo system.</strong> Based partially on personal preference, but <em>Waves</em> in particular felt incredibly awkward to me because of such a mechanic. The only way to do well in the game was to physically stop shooting and let the enemies accumulate so that you could shoot more of them faster for bonus points and a multiplier. This is frustrating. Any second spent not moving and shooting in a genre based entirely around moving and shooting should be only about pounding the desk in frustration in between lives. Exceptions exist, sure, like the "Dare Devil" bonus in <em>Beat Hazard</em> if you didn't shoot for a set amount of time, but forcing the game to revolve around it is a bad idea.

<em><strong>Not</strong></em><strong> sudden or often button pressing.</strong> Pressing buttons should be a rarity. Buttons can be powerful, and many games have clear-the-screen oh-shit-bombs in a limited capacity to help during tough times. <em>Super Stardust HD</em> had two buttons, one for bombs, one for a hyper-boost that needed to recharge. Both abilities were not used very often (although mastering the boost was crucial) but were decisive.

An aside: something <em>Stardust</em> did so, so, right: when you use either button ability, the boost or the bomb, you were essentially invincible. The boost could take you through enemies, doing damage, and the bomb not only destroyed enemy ships but enemy bullets as well. Pressing buttons like this that are often the pinnacle between staying alive and dying—and that already distract you and take your mind off the controls for a moment!—perform much much better when the risk of using an individual ability is low, though the risk of affecting the game itself is high.

Anyway. <em>Hexodius</em> is particularly bad about button presses: while the weapon upgrade system is novel and the rewards are thorough, the game requires you to have your fingers on all four shoulder buttons of a controller for nearly the entire game, and about half the abilities are available nearly all the time where the others are on arbitrary cooldowns. This is hell for the player, who (when he is me) spends half his time slamming the shoulder buttons when he wants to just shoot mans. A turret ability is very cool! Turrets and mines and firepower and speed, all independently managed, isn't so much.

<em><strong><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/super-stardust.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-220" alt="super stardust" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/super-stardust.png" width="240" height="240" /></a>Perhaps</strong></em><strong> a list of other fun items.</strong> This list isn't comprehensive and assumes plenty about twin-stick games, which are by and large roughly the same game and have many tropes that one can count on, should the developer have the time.
<ul>
	<li>The more modes of play, the better, particularly if they're all unique. <em>Stardust</em> did this right, with a campaign, individual level challenges, timed levels, and two different infinite modes, as well as bomb-only and boost-only modes.</li>
	<li>Multiplayer. Not all games are set up to play with two heroes, and that's fine. But allowing two buddies to speedrun the campaign mode, or even going the extra mile and programming up a competitive shooting frenzy, or going even further than that and making bots for enjoyment of multiplayer gametypes fun alone…all these things can only strengthen a game's playability.</li>
	<li>A sense of game progression. This was touched on earlier in parts but I wanted to place it here. Something simple like a campaign mode does well, rewarding the player with more, new, hopefully distinguishable and different levels to play in. Something more complex like unlocking new game modes, ships, and other physically game-changing options is even better.</li>
	<li>Options to control on-screen chaos. <em>Beat Hazard</em> again rears its ugly head. Playing the game at anything above 50% explosion ferocity rendered it nearly unplayable, as every shot was obscured. (And the slider goes up to 200%.) Dazzling special effects are always appreciated but the headache-induced or simply more competitive player will want to hone in on what's really important: shooting mans.</li>
	<li>Options for display visibility. Showing the number of lives in the corner conspicuously but not distractingly is always a hard balance. Showing other less constant information, like the number of shots left in a weapon or the number of enemies left in a level, can be even trickier. Oftentimes the easiest solution for a player who finds himself looking away is just to turn down the opacity of these elements, allowing him to look through them should he need to.</li>
	<li>Customization. Whether it's pointless (<em>Stardust</em>) or a method of showing off (the fifty different paintjobs brought up earlier), being able to affect the game without affecting the game will give a veteran a goal to strive toward, a newbie a reason to try the game, and a struggling player intermediate goals to check off.</li>
</ul>
I don't mean to rip too hard on some of the games I've mentioned. Most twin-stick shooters have some redeeming merits. <em>Stardust</em> may be unbalanced, but it's still a blast to play. <em>Hexodius</em> might be complicated but I played the demo to the end, and it wasn't a bad ride. <em>Beat Hazard…</em>well I had a lot of problems with that game but it was only one in a sea of raw, enjoyable shooting games. If any game ever comes out that solves all these problems, they could sell it for fifty bucks and I'd pay the price.

(after it went on sale on Steam for 75% off.)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[You might remember <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/i-dream-of-swimming/">the last time I posted</a> about having a dream on this blog, and guess what? I've had another. Names initialed to (somewhat) protect the innocent.

This time, I was a soldier in the military. I wore a uniform and a helmet and carried a gun, which I never got a very good look at. The enemy was the Nazis, because the enemy's always the Nazis. I didn't say this was entirely original.

The military that I saw was comprised entirely of people I knew, some of which I haven't talked to in months or even years. Ryan N., who I haven't seen since high school, was the leader of my squad. Brenna G. was there, along with people from high school and college both.

Here's where things got interesting. I never did figure out how, but somehow people in the squad were turning into zombies. (I know, Nazis and zombies, this is just like video games, shut up.) Giles H. was the first to turn into a zombie, but he just kind of shambled around, and no one wanted to put him out of his misery.

It got to a point where we were tired of slowly backing away from him that someone started doing military chants, and the power of the entire group of people yelling was enough to—get this—de-zombie Giles. His skin turned back to a normal color, his injuries cleaned up, and he was back in fighting shape.

So we went forward, yelling at everyone we could, shooting Nazis (and some Nazi zombies, so presumably that's where the zombie voodoo was coming from). I spent a lot of time saving Brenna, who seemed to inexplicably wander into danger a lot. One particular scene had me shooting two oncoming zombies before blasting the Nazi who was holding her around the neck right in the temple, a tricky shot at such a distance, and yelling, "Bullseye!" in response.

I think someone made fun of me for that comment but I didn't care, I'd saved her and made a great shot.

Eventually we made it to some Nazi base, which was a very futuristic building, lots of transparent panes and green metal architecture, with strange helicopters and planes and even weapons stuffed in hallways and rooms in which they barely fit. Walking through the base was creepy, but resistance was almost nonexistent.

We continued until we reached a bizarre contraption: a sliding pole, like the ones firefighters use, but in the middle of a ten-yard-wide tube with only a small door entrance, and a thin metal slide, about a foot wide, wrapping around the pole from top to bottom. Thus the way to travel was to jump from the door, make it the sizable distance to the slide, and then hold the pole as you slid downward.

The fall was large enough that I got cold feet when it was my turn to jump and stood to the side, letting everyone else jump ahead. The last two left were two paratroopers, Crystal C. and Micheala K., who weren't going down for whatever reason, so I talked to them for a few minutes. When it finally came time to jump, I had made it to the door and I don't remember if I jumped or not before

I woke up, sweating. That was one of the most intense experiences I've ever had while unconscious. I went back to sleep hoping the story would continue and it never did.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What Goes On: a list of Beatles anomalies</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A link to a website found <a href="http://wgo.signal11.org.uk/wgo.htm">here.</a>

This is an incredible collection of anomalies, defined as anything that sounds like it ought not to be there. Plenty of the more minor things, such as clicks and clacks of recording equipment being switched around and tracks being used are mostly gone from the newer remasters (at least they are from my 2009 stereo remasters) but there remains plenty of crud to look through.

Almost every song has some sort of vague mishap, though of particular note is the Yellow Submarine album, which has plenty of strange clicks (mostly mastered away now) as well as background voices (which have been partially mastered <em>back in</em>). Hey Jude has a "fucking hell" in the middle of it, yes, in the version played on the radio the world over. Blackbird's tapping is a mechanical metronome. Helter Skelter was played, well, helter skelter (and Ringo has the blisters). The end of While My Guitar Gently Weeps is hosed up by almost everyone playing.

There's plenty more, and at the very least it gave me an excuse to listen to some more obscure Beatles songs. Well worth a bit of time.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Steam summer sales</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/steam.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-252" alt="steam" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/steam.jpg" width="140" height="105" /></a>The Steam Summer Sale has officially ended, and it was well worth the time. I grabbed up Skyrim, Civilization V, The Walking Dead, and was gifted Ion Assault. Not a bad haul, and 100% of the games I bought came from Steam Wallet cash—TF2 items I sold on the market, or trading cards that I…sold on the market. Some thoughts:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trading Cards.</strong> What a brilliant system for absolutely everyone involved. Each game that has trading cards allows you to find half of the total drops through simply playtime. You can then craft them together for badges (which can give you other random rewards) or sell them on the market for between 10 and 30 cents a piece. This isn't a lot, but it can be a steady money flow. It also gets me playing some games in my Steam library I've either neglected or simply haven't returned to in a while. So it's good for me: more diversity and a little more cash in my internet pocket. It's good for developers, who see more people playing their games and can draw attention to whatever they like. It's good for Valve, who takes a cut of every single transaction on the market, which adds up very very quickly. So it's a win-win-win.</li>
	<li><strong>Skyrim.</strong> I already talked about it a good bit <a title="Thoughts on Skyrim." href="http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/thoughts-on-skyrim/">here</a>. You may have less choices than you like, but what's there is more and more refined and cohesive.</li>
	<li><strong>The Walking Dead.</strong> I haven't given myself the time to play this game a heck of a lot. I've gotten through some small part of the first episode, though, and this game is dramatic and good at telling a story. It was a friend of mine who showed me the game, a friend who watches the show and reads the comics (it's a comic, right?) and enjoyed it thoroughly. Telltale does well as usual.</li>
	<li><strong>Ion Assault.</strong> In my rush to try and find a good <a title="Necessities for twin-stick shooters." href="http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/necessities-for-twin-stick-shooters/">twin-stick shooter</a>, I put several demo-less games on Steam on my wish list, to check out later. A friend of mine saw Ion Assault on sale and bought it up as a nice present. Rather than just shooting bullets, you have to collect the particle floating around the level to deal damage. It doesn't follow every rule I wrote, but it definitely has a difficulty curve that I found myself obviously advancing along, which was enjoyable. And it has Trading Cards. So yeah.</li>
	<li><strong>Civilization V.</strong> This is apparently a very unpopular opinion, but I have had a lot of trouble thus far enjoying this game. The first game I played was with three other people and was riddled with connection issues, which, compounded with my entire unfamiliarity with the game made it hard to enjoy. Okay, sure. I played another game with two people and really just burned myself out and got incredibly bored an hour or two in, left with nothing to do and nowhere to go (and still only a mild understanding of things), so I quit playing. Slightly more recently I've tried to tackle the tutorials and they involve an incredible amount of reading and are perhaps <em>too</em> streamlined. I've been advised to just suck it up and play through a single player game with a low difficulty and presumably win, in order to feel for the whole game. When I get a bit more time I'll give it a run.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Bored Games, and my family</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My family's got a decent collection of board games. Five different Monopoly sets (for whatever reason), Trouble, Connect Four, a couple trivia games, a few other obscure ones, blah blah blah. Nothing so "strategic" like Risk or Axis and Allies, my dad is fully not a board game geek and so we just have miscellaneous games.

For a while, we had essentially three games that were choices on any given board game night. Six Cubes, Parcheesi, or Creationary.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/creationary.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-236" alt="creationary" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/creationary.png?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>Creationary is a Lego building game that works similarly to Pictionary. You have to build things and other people have to guess them. This game started out pretty fun but in the process of playing, the cards start to repeat a decent amount, and with only a couple people who can decently construct things in the house, it became tiring.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/six-cubes.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-237" alt="six cubes" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/six-cubes.jpg" width="196" height="183" /></a>Six Cubes is a fairly simple game. You have six dice and you roll them to achieve certain patterns, called "winners," which you can use to move your piece forward on the board. It's not, ah, un-fun, but the game is mindless re-rolling. In fact, the game is so simple, that I wrote a program to calculate all the possible rolls to see what the average progress was. The average score is 305, and since scores come in increments of 50 the only object was getting to 350 or failing while trying. So I personally got sick of it.

What we've been playing more since, and indeed played twice tonight, is Parcheesi. Parcheesi's a pretty old game, and it's similar to Trouble (or Trouble's similar to it). You move your four mans around the board according to your dice rolls. You get your dice as individual numbers, though, and there are ways to take pieces, block other pieces, and land on safe squares to keep yourself alive. There are also huge bonuses to successfully getting pieces home or taking other people's pieces. It's a great game of risk and reward, and has tense moments and strategy even in its somewhat random element of dice rolling.

There's a reason it's so old and yet people still play it. I wish we had more competitive games around.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So. Finally bought The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, after the Legendary Edition with the three expansion packs went on sale. I've played up to around level 10, with a couple major quests ticked off and various other minor tasks accomplished, and I have a few thoughts, partially in the game itself, partially in how it relates to the previous game, Oblivion.

The most obvious thing, and also the largest improvement over Oblivion, is the leveling system. In Oblivion, you leveled up based only on your major skills, which were set in stone at the beginning of the game. That, and you had to strictly level up your minor skills first, or you'd miss out on large portions of skill advances and get hosed as you got to higher and higher levels. In Skyrim, once you advance ten levels in any of your skills, you gain a level. You can apply the benefits of that level immediately. And you can pick a perk for any skill you like.

And—and this is crucial, and my entirely favorite part—<em>every single perk matters.</em> Some perks are cool, sure, like the "lockpicks never break" perk, but you have to have a high level to get there. End game rewards are expected to be game-changing. But even the first level of perks change the game. Every magic school's first perk is to halve the magic cost of novice-level spells, which are the spells you have right at the beginning of the game when you're trying to train yourself. It's genius. Weapon bonus damages go up 20% at a time, which is enough to matter, and you can jack that number all the way to 100%. You can double your damage. With five perks. That's huge. And brilliant.

The dialog seems to be more diverse than Oblivion's was. It helps a bit, perhaps, that the setting of the game has moved from the Imperial capital, the slightly generic white-man's-kingdom, to the somewhat more characteristic frosted land of Skyrim, home of the hardy Nords, who all have an accent. Even the outsiders, the Redguards and beast races and whoever else, have stronger accents than previously, to set everyone apart further.

The quest system is divided up a bit better. Major quests are shown by themselves, with a little bit of help to guide you through them. Minor quests are just straight-up listed in one block of text, and you can tackle them or ignore them as you please. Some of the minor quests are progressively generated, making the game world feel just a little bit more real. Why every single person in the world can only get help from me is anyone's guess, and even if the answer remains "it's a video game" the journey to get there is becoming more varied and free.

Interface runs a lot more smoothly, especially on the PC. You can navigate with the mouse entirely, or you can navigate with the keyboard (almost) entirely, or you can perform some combination of the two. It's mostly intuitive and simple. This was a big problem with Oblivion, where much of the inventory was mouse-only and poorly organized.

Perhaps one of the things I lament about the streamlining of the core systems is the loss of the outliers. Morrowind was big on having lots of distinctions between item types: there were three (technically four) armor types, seven weapon types, and 27 skills (with 8 attributes). Oblivion slimmed it down a bit, with only two armor classes and three weapon types, and 21 skills. Skyrim gets even slimmer, with 18 skills and none of your attribute bullshit (only the basic Health, Magicka, and Stamina, which are constant between almost all races).

Honestly, with such a wide-open system like Skyrim's, I'd love for its ease of use combined with the breadth of Morrowind or Oblivion. Give me Birthsigns. Give me curses. Give me persuasion. Give me underwater combat. Give me deeper potion-making. Give me breaking weapons. Give me six pieces of armor in a set. Give me custom spells. Give me spell success rates.

…you know, it wasn't until I started listing those until I realized what they were: stupid RPG clutter that took you out of the game for a bit so you could fiddle with statistics you didn't understand. Really, this is probably for the better. Go play Skyrim.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, years and years ago, our group of friends discovered <a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a>, a simple game, similar to Apples to Apples, but with horrendous, inappropriate, gross, and scandalous subject matter. It's really a lot of fun.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cards-against-humanity.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-244" alt="cards against humanity" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cards-against-humanity.jpg?w=300" width="240" height="240" /></a>What always baffled us a little was the black card, the subject card, which read, "This is the way the world ends / This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but with a ________." We figured it was a song lyric for the longest time. In fact we sometimes sung the answers when we read them out loud.

Just today I found a quote on the fantastic <a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/post/55610948689/chelonaut-a-woman-tells-her-programmer-husband">Profound Programmer</a> blog:
<blockquote>A woman tells her programmer husband to go to the store for some milk and while he’s there, get some eggs. He takes egg carton after egg carton, until there are none left. He reaches for empty space. The ground splits beneath his feet. The universe trembles and collapses.

This is how the world ends. Not with a bang but with a Null Pointer Exception.</blockquote>
Which inspired me to go a-hunting for what it really meant.

Turns out it's a poem, written by T. S. Eliot, called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men">The Hollow Men</a>," which is broadly about post-World War I subject matter, and contains the final stanza:
<blockquote>This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper.</blockquote>
So. There you have it. Often quoted, never credited. Sorry, Eliot.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/sex-drugs-cocoa-puffs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-264" alt="sex drugs cocoa puffs" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/sex-drugs-cocoa-puffs.jpg?w=195" width="195" height="300" /></a>My range of books I typically enjoy reading is somewhat limited in scope. I like a little bit of sci-fi, <em>Ender's Game</em> and its entire universe of sequels are some of my favorite books. I like a little bit of techno-thriller, Michael Crichton's <em>Prey</em> was amazing, and it's very cool to make fun of Dan Brown but I really liked <em>Deception Point</em> and <em>Digital Fortress</em>. I like World War II stories, <em>Flyboys</em> is one of my favorite all-time books, <em>Unbroken</em> was fantastic, and various other books (particularly about the Pacific theater) were all very very interesting.

But that's about all. Sure, I've read and liked other books. But that's essentially my collection.

My ladyfriend and I, in some attempt to be more informed and more interesting and more cool, have switched books. I gave her <em>Flyboys</em>, which is probably not really her cup of tea but certainly had a big impact on me. And she gave me <em>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</em>, a strange book by Chuck Klosterman, a collection of essays on pop culture and how it affects, well, everything.

Thus far it's funny, makes some good points, and is enjoyable if nothing else. It sparked a discussion about the impact of <em>The Real World</em> with my dad, which was provoking and is interesting in and of itself.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pacific-rim-jaws.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-270" alt="pacific rim jaws" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/pacific-rim-jaws.jpg" width="274" height="384" /></a>In the last week or so I've seen a few movies and they've all got me really thinking about the people and things contained in them, so I'd like to talk about them for a bit.

I saw <em>Pacific Rim</em> in theaters with a special someone and we both agreed that, while enjoyable, it wasn't a <em>great</em> movie. It was fun to watch, especially if you turn your mind off for a while.

The main character is a doofus and has awful dialog. Okay, sure. The only female in the movie (sorry, <a href="http://bechdeltest.com/">Bechdel Test</a>) is troubled but pretty and also a little kick-ass, which is nifty. One of the scientists behind the "decipher the alien brain" project is Charlie Day of <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadephia</em> and <em>Horrible Bosses</em> fame, who I really really like as an actor, and definitely adds to the movie in that he takes away from the serious dialog silliness. The robotic voice of the Jaegers is Ellen McLain, known mostly as GLaDOS from the Portal series (and the announcer in Team Fortress 2, incidentally), whose voice filter was actually licensed from Valve (though toned down) for the movie. What a cool little thing.

There is a part in the movie where the crew is held up by a man on a motorized cart, who only stops and glares at the main characters before continuing. He doesn't appear anywhere else, but his face is shown clearly. After a little surfing, I think it has to be the producer, Thomas Tull, though I may be way off base, as I don't remember the scene very well. Cameos are cool.

Just today we also had some time to spend and spent it watching <em>WarGames</em>, a "thriller" starring a very young Matthew Broderick as the accidental initiator of an almost-nuclear war. It's this movie that coined the "A strange game. The only winning move is not to play" line.

Originally I was arguing, having never seen it before, that the Matthew Broderick of this movie grows up and changes his name to Ferris Bueller (which we'd watched together a week ago). There are so many similarities: he has a computer, his room is upstairs, his parents are goofballs, he is a slacker in school, there is a goofy love interest, etc. etc.

But once he gets kidnapped for suspected Soviet espionage, that changes everything. The movie is very enjoyable, if a little goofy at times (but not in a bad way). Really, it's funny how after watching <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> (again a week ago) how much the War Room has changed in 30 years, yet the plot is still the same: "nuclear combat toe-to-toe with the Russkies."

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/wargames-the-book.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-271" alt="wargames the book" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/wargames-the-book.jpg" width="233" height="360" /></a>Oh, and the slightly foppish assistant in <em>WarGames</em> with the receding hairline and the thin mustache? An actor named Michael Ensign. I recognized him for his part as the hotel manager/owner in <em>Ghostbusters</em>, but turns out he was in <i>Titanic</i> and was the voice of Dr. N. Tropy in a good chunk of the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> games (which I would have never picked up on).

[An aside: it's funny that the only game he didn't play N. Tropy in is the one I played the most of, <em>Wrath of Cortex</em>, which might be why I never noticed. <em>Wrath of Cortex</em> had a shitload of other celebrity voices, though, including Clancy Brown (voice of Mr. Krabs among many other roles), Debi Derryberry (voice of Jimmy Neutron, among others), R. Lee Ermey (of <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>), Mark Hamill (… <em>Luke Skywalker</em>), Jess Harnell (a super prolific voice actor, including Wakko from <em>Animaniacs</em>), and Tom Wilson (Biff from <em>Back To The Future</em>). What a hell of a cast for an ultimately moderately bland, "safe" game.]

Anyway. I digress. A lot. Basically, I have been watching more movies lately, I have liked most of them, and the more I watch movies the more I appreciate the people that go into them. The End.

[epilogue: while surfing through <em>WarGames</em> links I found <a href="http://defconwarningsystem.com/">this website</a>, dedicated to guessing the DEFCON level of the United States military. The site's been running for 30 years, so Netscape users beware.

epilogue two: while surfing through <em>Pacific Rim</em> websites I found <a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/go-tigers.png">this gem</a> buried in the comment section. What was a discussion on proper dictation turned into a sports chant. (Also, go Tigers.) ]]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/risk.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282" alt="risk" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/risk.png" width="400" height="106" /></a>A couple of friends and I played a game of Risk, just for the hell of it, and it didn't take nearly as long as I'd thought it should, and it wasn't until I actually sat down with the rules that I figured out why.

Normally, in Risk, the attacker rolls (up to) three dice, representing his three attacking army men. The defender rolls only <em>two</em> dice, but wins ties, representing his less active but much hardier men.  This creates an advantage to the attacking army, who (particularly with larger armies) will win out the majority of the time.

However, the version we unwittingly played (referred to as Italian Risk) uses three defensive dice. This creates a large advantage to the defenders, who now win the majority of individual conflicts.

I did a little bit of programming, which felt good after a long summer, and got some simple numbers:
<ul>
	<li>Under standard rules, in any single battle where the attacker rolls all three dice and the defender rolls both dice, the attacker defeats two armies about 37% of the time, ties 34% of the time, and loses two armies 29% of the time. In other words, the attacker <em>does not lose</em> 71% of the time. That's huge.</li>
	<li>Under Italian rules, in any single battle where both sides roll all three dice, the attacker defeats three armies about 14% of the time, defeats two armies 21% of the time, loses two armies 26% of the time, and loses all three armies 38% of the time. (I know that equals 99; rounding errors.) In other words, the attacker comes out on top 35% of the time (using the correct percentages). That's tiny.</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, these percentages don't plug very well into probable-win scenarios. Partially because it's late and partially because working with strings of complicated probabilities is confusing, I can't work out the math that should go into this. Still, though, knowing the 71% and the 35% numbers are neat—attacking with equal numbers in standard Risk will only leave you unable to conquer the enemy rarely, where attacking with equal numbers in Italian Risk is a risky proposition.

If I ever a) sit down and figure out the math or b) consult someone smarter than I, then I will record the full probabilities of winning battles in Italian Risk, which is not documented anywhere that I can see, where standard Risk <em>is</em> (but could still use a rework). Until then, I'll just play defensively.]]></content:encoded>

Presented without context, because context is for losers and it wouldn't help most of these anyway.

"…and I hope Coldplay gets fucking dropped by fucking EMI and ends up like the Stone fucking Roses, who were actually a better band, all things considered."

"Computers make children advance faster, but it also makes them think like computers."

"Whenever I see repeat episodes of [<em>Real World 3</em>], I find myself deconstructing every casual conversation Judd and Pam have, because I know a secret they don't—eighteen months later, they will have sex. It's sort of like seeing old Judas Priest videos on VH1 Classic and looking for signs of Rob Halford's homosexuality."

"You know how historians call people who came of age during World War II 'the greatest generation'? No one will ever say that about us. We'll be 'the cool generation.' That's all we're good at…"

<strong>"Had Bruce [Springsteen] written "Paradise by the Dashboard Light," people would be playing it at weddings."</strong>

"Marilyn Monroe was the perfect vessel for an age where it was wrong to want wild, easy sex; [Pamela Anderson] is the perfect vessel in an age where not wanting wild, easy sex makes you a puritanical, born-again weirdo."

"What's interesting about this evolution is that the value of a movie like <i>Star Wars</i> was vastly underrated at the time of its release and is now vastly overrated in retrospect."

"Viewed objectively, R2-D2 is like a dwarf holding a Simon."

"Producers want to develop movies they can refer to as "high concept," which—somewhat ironically—is industry slang for "no concept": It describes a movie where the human element is secondary to an episodic collection of action sequences."

"Quite simply, [page designers] are trying to create a newspaper that can be appreciated by the illiterate."]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The new school year.</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Four days of the new school year down. That wasn't so hard, right?

Thus far, I've dropped a class and added a new one…so where my earliest class was previously at 9:30, it is now at 7:30. This doesn't seem fair, but it's all I could do in the situation.

Lesson officially learned: don't take a <em>majority</em> of difficult classes in a semester, particularly if you're taking 17 credit hours of things. That is a fast track to being overwhelmed.

So, after the change, I'm in Spanish (because I need two years of a language and Spanish is the easiest choice), Physics (because Physics minor), and two separate computer science classes, Software Engineering (so that I can work in a team) and Programming Language Concepts (so I can use lots of programming languages or something).

In addition, I'm working a few hours a week in the computer lab, basically resetting passwords for people and occasionally helping people with their programming questions. It ain't much, but it's easy cash for homework time.

I'm feeling a little stressed, even after the schedule change, because there's a lot of time required for a lot of things. But we'll see how the year goes.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Computer science-ing, or why alumni aren't interesting but doing work is fun</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, Microsoft put on a "coding competition" in Kauffman Hall here on campus. It was billed as an opportunity to talk to some UNL alumni, do some coding, and get a chance to win some prizes. Sounds cool, sure, so a friend of mine and I went and signed up.

We learned upon getting there that we could have three members on a team, not just two, which was mildly notable, especially considering the haphazard structure of the contest, where everyone on a team was allowed to work on a computer by themselves. This also directly contrasted the original bulletin about the contest, but hey, things change, no big deal.

So we signed up, pizza and soda were brought in (which wasn't really discussed beforehand), and soon we were given a URL to access to get the program instructions and sample inputs/outputs. So my friend and I downloaded everything and set to work in our language of choice, chosen as Java simply for familiarity and previous coding competition experience in Java.

What we found in the problems, though, were various inconsistencies and problems withing the descriptions. One problem told of a certain format for output and the sample output was formatted differently. Various parts were unclear and required a few clarifications. The contest overall was inconsistent, where different problems talked about different methods of input and output. One problem was literally "code a Sudoku solver," which was easily searchable on the internet (and thus a very poor idea for a challenge problem). In fact that was one of the first things I did, though I didn't turn it in.

We set to coding. And, for roughly one hour, we did just that. Coding mostly independently, we worked on five of the six problems (minus the Sudoku solver), and solved three, sort of. Included accidentally in the original contest files were the judges' inputs for the program, which were to be computed yourself! and the output turned in as plain text. So,  one could just…work out the problems manually and turn in the text files. One of our solutions didn't work on the sample input but worked correctly on the final input, so we left it alone.

We were honest about actually coding solutions, lest we get called out in front of strangers (and a few people we knew, including my friend's girlfriend) so we just submitted the three we'd honestly solved (including the one we'd 90% solved but had solved for every case included in the final tally) when the time was up.

Four different teams got three problems right. That's great. That's really cool. So how do you break a tie like that? Well while one judge was tabulating results, the other two raffled off a Surface tablet (one that <em>apparently</em> Microsoft is trying to get rid of because of its poor support) and a pair of headphones. They randomly picked a winner using a function in an Excel spreadsheet, which was fair and random. And that was it.<em>
</em>

But for the four team who got three problems right? The winner was based on submission time. So the winning team had actually submitted their three correct problems far ahead of the actual time deadline, because they didn't think they would get any more right. Despite the official instructions saying that all teams would have about 10 minutes after the "coding" part was over to submit their results, the final winner was judged on submission time, which shouldn't have mattered in any form.

So we lost. I suppose the winning team won fair and square—we were told that the winners would be picked based on submission time up front. But the inherent unfairness of such a system didn't sink in too far (and I was very close to solving a fourth problem), so we lost. The final prize was only a $150 gift card, not the end of the world, but it's still really disappointing how the entire contest was managed.

Fast forward to today. As part of a computer engineering course I'm taking, the members of the class were split into four "teams" and given a mildly complicated list of expectations for building and programming a hypothetical desk phone. We were given a limited amount of time to iron out the individual details of the phone's operation and then given a quiz over tiny edge cases covering the phone's operation.

The important thing to take away from the quiz is not that there was a "right" answer, but rather that everyone in a team should have the <em>same</em> answer. That is, the specification should be understood in the same way by everyone, if possible. Our team, the Green team, did poorly the first day due to time constraints (not enough time to finalize system behavior!), but took charge and managed to do very well on the second, taking the victory at first but actually getting the second-most amount of points due to a counting error.

That was a lot of fun. There was a drawing on the markerboard, there was discussion about "proper" phone behavior, there were a couple jokes thrown around, generally a positive experience.

Right before the class, an alum working at Garmin and two former engineering students from Microsoft (two of the judges from the programming contest) showed up to talk to the class about what projects they had in the pipeline and where their companies were going. The Garmin presenter had a couple pieces of hardware—one a camera for strapping onto a helmet for hikers/bikers, one a sort of iPod touch running Android and Garmin software, without phone capabilities—and the Microsoft presenters just talked about their work on Bing and how their teams functioned day-to-day.

Sure, a little of the information from the Microsoft presenters was interesting (like the concept of "four hours work, four hours discussion/publishing/etc."). But, overall? The Microsoft presenters were not organized at either event. The Garmin guy was boring and didn't have anything to say. And we the computer scientists and computer engineers and electrical engineers and what have you are supposed to be wetting ourselves with joy over working for these companies, is the impression I keep feeling from professors and other muckety-mucks.

Coding for an hour was fun, especially when I haven't done such a thing in a while. Working in a group with a whiteboard and a time limit was fun and eventually satisfying, when we "won" and ultimately had fun working as a team. But the industry representatives who are supposed to be getting us excited about their work? Thus far this year, they haven't done a very good job.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, what a busy heck of a week. It's homecoming week in Nebraska, which means a lot of silly competition, long days, and longer nights.

Things kicked off Sunday with a 5K Fun Run around campus and back, which I ran in a mock jail suit I have. You know, prisoner running away from the police kind of thing. I ran the whole thing, to my credit (since I haven't run a 5K since high school cross country) and promptly collapsed into a bright orange heap. I didn't actually feel better for three or four days. Stairs are hard!

Monday was Monday Night Live, a large skit-off between all the participating Greek houses, residence halls, and student organizations. You can see our entry in <a title="Neihardt’s “Be a Husker” skit for homecoming!" href="http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/10/02/neihardts-be-a-husker-skit-for-homecoming/">my previous post</a>, which we won Monday Night Live with! This was a lot of fun, despite some <em>late</em> nights spent practicing with some very encouraging (and tired) folks.

Tuesday and Wednesday there was a blood drive, which is a train I do not ride. Thursday there was a country music concert, which is a train I do not ride.

But Friday was the parade, with lots of floats and banners and things, which Neihardt participated in, minus me, because I was Neihardt's candidate for the Homecoming Biggest Fan! The competition is between, again, all the halls/Greeks/organizations, and there is a three-round elimination contest where each potential jester gets a very short amount of time (15 seconds!) to woo the judges and encourage a crowd to cheer. I placed second behind a girl who could twirl and throw a baton, which I fully regard as cheating—you can't enter a talent competition with an actual talent!

In all seriousness, though, she well deserved it. She got pictures taken and had the chance to meet Jack Hoffman, the namesake of the Huskers' Team Jack movement, which is really cool!

Today was the conclusion of the big week with the homecoming game against Illinois, meeting for the first time since 1986. With Illinois on a hot streak, the Blackshirts in question, and Taylor still injured, I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. The World-Herald pre-game score prediction was 35-30, which I didn't see as being too far off.

What ended up happening was far more spectacular. The Blackshirts lived up to their name for most of the game, Tommy Armstrong, RKIII, Ameer Abdullah, and Kenny Bell led the offense to big plays and big points early, and the only real problems came after we had built up a sizable lead in the second half. All in all, fun to watch, and plenty to cheer for, though it could certainly have been a little warmer.

Now I'm exhausted, and facing the first night to myself in a long long time. I think I'll go play video games and forget everything for a while.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>What being a soccer goalie and being a hardware architect have in common</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First, before you go any further, I implore you to read <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1309_14-17_mickens.pdf">this short, three-page essay</a> about being a hardware architect (and working with computers in general). It's written by James Mickens, a Microsoft man, and is entirely ridiculous and hilarious on a base level, so it will be enjoyable to read.

Next, I want to draw your attention to a few specific parts. I'm first going to quote parts of the beginning of the essay, because it's the most important and has the most to do with what I'm trying to say.
<blockquote>I think that it used to be fun to be a hardware architect. Anything that you invented would be amazing, and the laws of physics were actively trying to help you succeed. Your friend would say, "I wish that we could predict branches more accurately," and you'd think, "maybe we can leverage three bits of state per branch to implement a simple saturating counter," and you'd laugh and declare that such a stupid scheme would never work, but then you'd test it and it would be 94% accurate…at some point, you realize that to implement aggressive out-of-order execution, you need to fit more transistors into the same die size, but then a material science guy pops out of a birthday cake and says YEAH WE CAN DO THAT, and by now, you're touring with Aerosmith and throwing Matisse paintings from hotel room windows…When you retire in 2003, your face is wrinkled from all of the smiles…you go out on top, the master of your domain.</blockquote>
I started playing on a select soccer team when I was 11 or 12 or something, and for the first half of my first fall season, I didn't do very much. I hardly played, I had no foot skills, and I just couldn't contribute. I'd played a little bit of goalie in my rec leagues prior to this, but had never gotten the chance to try such a thing out in practice or a game. So I went up to my coach,  my over-six-foot-tall former-Kenyan-national-team coach, and asked if I could try being a goalie.

He looked all the way down to me and pretended to laugh. "Ha. Ha ha."

Then he hesitated. "We will see."

Come the end of practice, he put me in the net and lined the entire rest of the team up on some arbitrary line, maybe 15 or 20 yards away.  He then told me that if I saved 10 goals from the entire team, I would start in goal in Saturday's game.

I saved 12. And started in goal on Saturday.

I don't remember exactly how well I did when I first started playing goalie, but I learned from the best: my coach, Martin Mwita, was a goalie back in his day. So he knew. He knew how to teach, he knew how to inspire, he knew what a goalie should and should not be responsible for. He taught me to charge the ball <em>anytime</em> it was inside the goalie box and not being covered by another player, unlike almost every other 11- and 12-year-old goalie, who sat on the goal line and waited for a shot. Be bold. Be brave. Be aggressive.

My dad started calling me "Suicidal Sam." My team loved me. Other forwards feared me. Even when I was learning how to play, trying to come out of the goal with arms and legs spread in hopes of taking a bad dribble or a poor shot from a enemy, it was intimidating, and frustrating, and difficult to work around. Essentially, teams <em>had</em> to pass the ball while in the goal box to get around my charges, and my defense was solid enough that actually doing that and scoring quickly was hard.

I won't say we won every game, but we won plenty, and every game was close—our losses came  from not enough offense more than not enough defense. Being a goalie was fun. It was easy, in some sense. It was vastly rewarding. Kids didn't know what to do against me. Every little thing I learned for myself or picked up from Martin or opposing forwards greatly accelerated my effectiveness. Week to week, I was getting noticeably better.

I was on that team, team Simba, until I was 14 or so. We won our league, beating out Gretna in the championship match, and Martin was ousted from his coaching job the following season because of horrible horrible politics. Those two, two-and-a-half years were some of the most fun times in my life. I found something I was good at, progressed quickly, and we won games with it.

I want to now draw your attention to the latter half of the essay, which is about the fictional main character's fictional son, John.
<blockquote>Regardless, John was changed forever, and when he grew up and became a hardware architect, he poured all of his genius into making transistors smaller and more efficient. For a while, John's efforts were rewarded with ever-faster CPUs, but at a certain point, the transistors became so small that they started to misbehave. They randomly switched states; they leaked voltage; they fell prey to the seductive whims of cosmic rays that, unlike the cosmic rays in comic books, did not turn you into a superhero, but instead made your transistors unreliable and shiftless…</blockquote>
The entire essay makes better points than I can pull from these quotes; work with me.

When I started playing soccer in high school, I began on the junior varsity team, same as all the freshmen but one in my class. We practiced together and we played games and I played maybe half goalie, because the JV team had a goalie already. So I played a little midfield, which was okay because I was fast and could run for a while, but I still didn't have the foot skills to really compete. Our JV team wasn't very good, and we didn't win a lot of games.

In my sophomore year, almost the entire crop of freshmen below me were moved up to varsity. This was absurd. They were younger than us!

Okay, so, in all honesty, at least half of them <em>probably</em> deserved to be on varsity. The rest were just there. I won't lie and say that Steve Muller was the greatest coach in the world, because he wasn't, and he knows this. But, regardless, those things happened. Most important to me among all the freshmen that had moved up was a goalie, Trey, who was supposed to be pretty good, and the next-in-line after Joel, the senior goalie my sophomore year, graduated.

I'll fast-forward a bit and explain away my junior and senior years pretty quickly. I didn't play hardly any varsity my junior year (though I was now starting for JV), and only a little bit more my senior year (when I did not play JV). My one shining moment that redeemed me in the eyes of my coach (and probably my team) was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCUnrq4XeI4">this single penalty stop</a>, which I only had to make because our first-string goalie got himself a yellow card immediately before the kick happened. It saved a post-season game, which felt really good. I'm proud of it.

But what I really want to drive home here is the fact that I did not play varsity goalie very much at all specifically because I was not as technically proficient as the starting goalie. What happened? Why was charging guys not working anymore? Where did "Suicidal Sam" go? <em>How</em> many points did we lose by?

In truth, being a goalie was never about that. Sure, it's good to have those skills, and being aggressive as a goalie is a valuable skill to have, and can catch guys off-guard in certain situations. I have no doubt in my mind about that.

But where my heyday was progress where my opponents could make none, my high school career was the progress of my opponents up, around, and over me. Forwards could pass to each other, or to  the midfield. Forwards could overload one side of the box, or spread the field such that I had to stay home, because my defense didn't have the manpower to pick up every single guy. Charging only worked in a small subset of situations, and positioning and diving and being thoroughly mindful of the players on the field became ten times more important.

And that's where I was lost. I got passed by, passed up because of my backwards mindset, my 1990s hardware architect mindset.

Sure, I like to think that I had the edge over the starting goalie in some areas, and I sure like to think that we were just "different" goalies and that I was getting a bad break, and I sure like to think that the decision to pick up the entire freshmen class and carry them with the big boys was part of a huge gamble on the future success of the team (which, funny enough, didn't work), and I sure like to think that Steve Muller just plain didn't like me, or had some other political reason to pick Trey over me.

But, honestly, the system advanced too fast, and passed me by. I still like soccer, and even as my brother is getting into it now, I don't know how to help him get better. I'm an hour away most days, but even if I wasn't, my brand of soccer explodes off the launch pad in a fiery burst! then crashes into the ground some fifty feet ahead.

As a soccer player who had to figuratively deal with the problems in the essay, and as a computer science major who will be literally dealing with the problems in the essay, the world is difficult.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Moulin Rouge vs. The Great Gatsby, in musical terms</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/moulin-rouge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-310" alt="moulin rouge" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/moulin-rouge.jpg?w=208" width="208" height="300" /></a>About a week ago (or so), Cassie and I watched Moulin Rouge, a strange, incredibly unique stage-like story, entirely full of covers of popular songs from the 70s, 80s, 90s. It had a lot of heart and was entertaining above all else.

Today, on a bus ride back from Minneapolis (where I went this weekend, which was fun except for the Husker game!), The Great Gatsby, the new one, was playing. Which was... interesting.

In the first five minutes of Gatsby, we're transported inside one of the wild parties, which you would expect to have some vaguely familiar music playing in the background! Jazz, big band, swing, anything remotely 1900-1940s would have been appropriate for a roaring twenties movie.

Nope. The first song is Jay-Z. <strong>Jay-Z.</strong>

In fact, the entire movie soundtrack (or at least everything I remember) is modern rap and hip-hop songs. Which is <em>really really</em> jarring. This is where the comparison comes in. Where Moulin Rouge is so overly surreal, every song they sing feels like a stage performer winking at the audience. Where Gatsby is so completely a "stereotypical" early-1900s movie, the completely blatant modern music kills the mood and prevents the movie itself from being a classic in any sense.

I always liked The Great Gatsby, the book. Or at least, I liked the story, until I had to analyze it to death in my English class. After that I fell out of touch with it, but here I am some years later, and I was willing to listen again. I like the story. It's interesting and wild and coincidental and fun.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/gatsby-character-map.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-311" alt="gatsby character map" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/gatsby-character-map.jpg?w=182" width="182" height="300" /></a>And truth be told, the rest of the movie does well. Tobey Maguire, who is kind of a dork, is the main character, who is…kind of a dork. Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a good actor and a good portrayer of semi-villains, is Gatsby, who is both of those things. The fact that Leonardo delivers a more convincing performance than Tobey is <em>itself</em> reflective of the two characters in the movie. Which I really liked. (This is similar to John Travolta's performance in Pulp Fiction, where the actor himself brings power to a role.)

Bottom line, Gatsby has exactly one surprise, and it ruins quite a bit, but everything around that isn't a bad show. Also Moulin Rouge is a menagerie of art, and worth a watching.

[an edit: something that was brought up later was that if Gatsby wanted to use modern music, it really ought to have gone whole hog and just been a modern remake, akin to Romeo + Juliet (which was a very weird movie). It wasn't until I was looking up more information about these three films that I realized, of course they made me think of each other: they're all directed by Baz Luhrmann. What an interesting guy.]]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/audiosurf-2.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-325" alt="audiosurf 2" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/audiosurf-2.png" width="250" height="126" /></a><strong>Audiosurf 2.</strong> Sequel to the best "plug your music files in, play" game out there, Audiosurf 2 expands on the original in just about every way possible. While this game is still in early access, it's well worth the time and money. The new Wakeboard modes let you perform incredible airborne stunts during dramatic parts of your music, some of the modes from the original Audiosurf are available for play (with more coming soon), and <em>enormous</em> support for Steam Workshop, including new skins and game modes, some of which essentially only use the fact that Audiosurf recognizes music to drive vaguely-related gameplay. The developer is very active on the official Audiosurf forums and has been putting out a skin or mod every week for some time, all of which are fun and well-put-together. Definitely worth a look.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/spelunky.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-326" alt="spelunky" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/spelunky.jpg?w=300" width="180" height="158" /></a><strong>Spelunky.</strong> The Steam edition of the original, Game Maker game (also released on XBL), Spelunky is a ruthless platformer with permadeath, where the only sense of game progression is the meager shortcuts you can unlock between worlds. You choose a skin and dive into the caves, armed with a few bombs and ropes to get you out of any tight spot. You only get more health by carrying distressed damsels (or pugs) to the exit, guarded by monsters and traps of all kinds. Each level is short, less than three minutes, but racking up consecutive rounds (particularly "oh, just one more try" moments) is too easy to do. The controls are airtight and every unfortunate death feels like your own fault, sometimes a challenge for randomly generated games. Oh, and did I mention co-op? I'm pretty sure I mentioned co-op, which is as hilarious as it is rewarding.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/dont-starve.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-327" alt="don't starve" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/dont-starve.png?w=263" width="158" height="180" /></a><strong>Don't Starve.</strong> A take on a survival game, you take on the character of Wilson, a Gentleman Scientist stranded on an island, with only his wits and his handiness to keep him alive. Wilson's only method of communication is the sound of a violin, subtitled for your convenience. To stay alive, Wilson must constantly be looking for food to keep his stomach full (and his hit points up), as well as flowers to keep his sanity in check. The progression of your items is very clearly defined,  you always know what you might want to be crafting next, and Wilson can use just about anything he finds to help him, whether it be tall grass made into a bed roll or stone and tree logs for a pickaxe. The game has a wonderfully well-crafted hand-drawn style, and everything is explained just well enough to make you feel confident but never explained such that you don't need to do any experimenting. The Steam Workshop is all over this title, too.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/desktop-dungeons.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-328" alt="desktop dungeons" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/desktop-dungeons.jpg?w=300" width="180" height="114" /></a><strong>Desktop Dungeons.</strong> This game was originally a Game Maker game, too, long long ago, though it's been purely a web-based game for quite some time. Just recently, with a large amount of content, UI, and other polish updates, the announcement was made about the move to Steam. This is a dungeon crawler with a sense of progression -- each dungeon you clear nets you gold, which can unlock other quests as well as make limited advantages available for further dungeon runs. The dungeons are one screen each, and are designed to be played in ten minutes each, so you can drop in and drop out as necessary. With a huge amount of content in the form of classes, races, a ludicrously difficult puzzle mode, and the variety of the different monsters and traps, this game can last a man years.

<strong><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/pinball-arcade.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-334" alt="pinball arcade" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/pinball-arcade.jpg?w=300" width="270" height="107" /></a>Pinball Arcade.</strong> A free-to-play game recently released on Steam, this brings loads of classic pinball games into your computer for your enjoyment. The same company making this game made two different pinball collections for the PS2, which were both a lot of fun to play, and the PC version comes with even more polish and content. The free version only comes with one table, but you can try any other tables for free or buy them individually or in packs.

<strong><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/the-forgotten.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-329" alt="the forgotten" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/the-forgotten.png?w=300" width="180" height="111" /></a>Age of Empires II: The Forgotten.</strong> A fanmade expansion for the original Age of Empires II, updated for the HD re-release on Steam and made official, introduces most significantly five new "forgotten" empires to the game: the Italians, Incas, Slavs, Indians, and Magyars (each with completely new units and technologies), as well as four new campaigns, new multiplayer modes, and various other tweaks to AI and gameplay. It also adds built-in support for spectating matches and streaming through twitch.tv, ever-helpful. This game is, in my not-very-well-versed opinion, one of the best and most fun RTS games of all time, and this update only makes it better.

<strong><a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/assault-android-cactus.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-336" alt="assault android cactus" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/assault-android-cactus.png?w=300" width="240" height="175" /></a>Assault Android Cactus.</strong> I had almost not included this one, but I played the five-level demo just this morning and it is fantastic. It's a twin-stick shooter, a genre I have very high expectations for, and it plays wonderfully. In the demo, you can choose from four different androids, each with a different primary and special weapon, and gameplay includes lots of enemies, alternate challenges in dark levels and boss battles, special powerups, and lots of fun. Single-player and local-co-op are included, always great for twin-sticks. This game, like Audiosurf 2, is in Early Access on Steam, so you can "beta-test" the game right now. I haven't actually bought this one yet, but it's on the top of my wish list.

Games cost money. But these games are worth it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Nebraska 27, Northwestern 24</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/westerkamp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-321" alt="westerkamp" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/westerkamp.jpg" width="628" height="418" /></a>I'm not going to rehash everything that's been said about this game. It wasn't the most consistent game in the world and certainly not our best game this year, even, but it had one of the most exciting long-shot finishes I've seen. Nope, I want to talk about being in the crowd.

With 3:16 on the clock in the fourth quarter and the game still tied at 21, the Huskers had the ball on their own 18 yard line. After about five plays, Tommy Armstrong throws a strange pass, directly intercepted by Northwestern, who brings it back to the 7 yard line.

At this point, people start streaming out of Memorial Stadium. A media timeout is called and the mass exodus begins. I'm seated right above one of the exits, with the rest of the student section immediately to the right of it.  We heckle some of the people walking out, particularly the younger ones, with cries of "Hey, hey! Where you going?" and a couple, quieter, sarcastic "Fair-weather fans!" thrown in for good measure.

One of the other students yells at a guy, "The game's not over yet!"

The guy, covered head-to-toe in Husker gear, barely slows down to point at the kid and look him in the eye. "This game is over."

The clock reads 2:25. The students stay put. Northwestern gets the ball down to the one, but between three different timeouts and at least one or two injury timeouts, ends up losing yardage and sitting on the 4 yard line on fourth down, thanks to some great lockdown defense. NW kicks the field goal, putting them up 24-21.

More fans leave. There aren't too many snippy comebacks. Driving the length of the field is tough enough, and with the clock reading 1:20 and no timeouts left, it seems almost all hope is lost. But the students stay put.

Ron Kellogg III goes in. A couple short pass plays. A sack. An amazing fourth-down 16-yard pickup, reviewed by the officials (which gives us more time to think). Another quick first down. NW calls their final timeout with four seconds to go. After the break, RKIII launches a missile into the end zone, bouncing off a pile of players and winding up in the waiting hands of Jordan Westerkamp, his first career touchdown.

The instant the ball touches his hands, the stadium explodes. No one can think. No one can breathe. I can't speak for everyone, but I couldn't even yell properly, I was so happy. Happy for the Huskers. Happy we could shut down Northwestern. Happy that the season still had a lot of potential.

But most of all, happy that the single fan who thought the game was over was wrong, very wrong.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Brief thoughts on experience levels</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Something we mentioned today in software engineering is the use of documentation for the three levels of users for your product.

Expert: someone who is very well versed in your product should be able to use it efficiently and quickly. Someone who has a lot of experience with Excel, for example, knows the keyboard shortcut for creating a graph from a selection of text (which is F11 or Alt-F1, depending on what you want to do).

Casual: someone who has used your product before and has some level of proficiency, but does not know the ins and outs. A casual user of Excel would be able to find the button in the interface for creating a graph -- certainly slower than F11, but easy to find and deduce should they have forgotten.

Novice: someone who has never or barely touched your product. A novice user of Excel, the sort of person who does not even know that you can create charts out of data (or has never done so before), would need to actively search for the "make a graph" button, which should be intuitive and easy.

People talk about being "pros" with Excel over most other Office products and it's because Excel is probably the most powerful and the least intuitive, but (<em>But!</em>) its learning curve is clear and satisfying. The more I work with spreadsheets, the more I appreciate shortcuts.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[A brief tale of computers, algorithms, logic, love, hate, and widescreen monitors.

Generally the SRC, in the basement of the computer science building, has people going in and out of it, generally to see their TAs or meet with their group to work on CS homework and projects. Most students come in a couple times, talk to their TA, and leave, without looking back (and without knowing how to open the door poorly labeled "Push").

Maybe four to six students were here for nearly the entire semester, or at least every time I was working. With the Thursday and Friday late shifts, it generally wasn't TA office hour time, and so the crowd varied from "this homework is due tomorrow, shit" to "this homework was due a week ago, shit" to just nobody here, minus those students. Perennially working, forever turning in things late, always getting extensions and help.

Two of them in particular, whose names I never learned, needed quite a bit of help near the middle of the year. Both were reasonably able to work computers but were not well versed in using Java in the way their class required -- and really, that's fine, this is school, a place to learn.

The intensity of the help they asked for increased to almost a breaking point, right after the final difficult assignment was due, about 2/3 of the way through the semester. The two of them were sitting on either side of me, both completely lost in their enormous project, both doing completely different things completely incorrectly. I turned my attention back and forth, trying to split my time evenly, trying to figure out what was wrong (because I sure didn't know, or I would have told them). I spent a five-hour Thursday shift and a three-hour Friday shift exclusively helping these two -- on Friday I didn't even log in to my own computer.

I was exhausted, but their programs worked, finally, and we were both happy. To this day, one of them is still periodically in the SRC, just to study I presume, and he always says hi to me and calls me by name (which makes me feel bad that I don't know his), and it's great, and I feel good for helping him.

Just tonight, a slightly older gentleman, the only person in the SRC besides me on the last day of the semester, and the last SRC shift before spring, calls me over to help him with his computer science homework. He's working on algorithms and doesn't understand how to use a binary search tree in one of his homework problems. He has a binder of notes on trees and the homework printed out, and I have an empty markerboard before me.

It's great. In the span of maybe forty minutes, I relearn how binary trees and binary search trees are distinct, and what a heap is, and how to remove elements from each of those (heaps are hard), and indeed we both sit down and think on the bonus question and take 20 of those minutes to draw out different solutions on the markerboard, and after two or three refinements finally arrive at the correct answer, which I explain and he asks questions about and understands.

It was good for me, a review of my own CS classes. It was good for him, a guy who needed some help with his homework and got a perfectly acceptable lesson in trees and algorithms. And it was particularly fulfilling, to find the sense of discovery in making the algorithm work, in explaining and seeing him understand even in the space of minutes. Not always do I love working the desk, because not everyone is like this fellow. But tonight it was worth it.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Super Smash Bros. 4 roster analysis</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, Super Smash Bros. 4 will be a thing next year, and of course everyone's going nuts over who's going to make the cut, who will return from past games, and which newcomer will surprise everyone next. After sitting down to do a little thinking I decided to come up with this fancy-dancy chart, which plots all the characters from the first three Smash games, the current confirmed roster for 4, and a few predictions for the remaining cast.

Some notes, and explanations on my current thoughts:
<ul>
	<li>I don't think there's any way in hell that the original cast of 12 doesn't return for a fourth game, so Yoshi, Jigglypuff, Captain Falcon, and Ness are the safest bets of all.</li>
	<li>Zelda/Sheik, Ganondorf, Falco, Ice Climbers, and Mr. Game and Watch are all Melee vets, so their inclusion is highly likely.</li>
	<li>The Dr. Mario to Wario transition was sort-of a case of "different character, same universe" (even though Wario is labeled as his own universe) so Wario remains questionable. Rosalina could potentially be the Mario-universe updated character (not shown on the chart), or the Mario-and-others universe could expand, keeping him.</li>
	<li>Pichu, a Pokemon representative, was turned into the Pokemon Trainer in Brawl. With the multiple-characters-in-one-slot mechanic being so uncommon, I think the Trainer returns, but with a different set of starters from a different generation.</li>
	<li>Lucario replaced Mewtwo, so it's likely that Lucario gets replaced with some Pokemon of the moment. Not taking a specific guess on this one, but I think Lucario's return is unlikely, particularly if any modern Pokemon want to see inclusion—the franchise is very heavily represented already (assuming a new Trainer), so even <em>more</em> Pokemon is unlikely.</li>
	<li>Ike replaced Roy, so another Fire Emblem character is likely to replace Ike. I don't know anything about Fire Emblem so I have no guesses, but Ike is probably out.</li>
	<li>Diddy Kong, as the first expansion of the underrepresented Donkey Kong universe (though sharing ground with the Mario universe) likely makes a return. Potentially he is swapped for another DK universe character, or potentially another is added (Cranky? Dixie? One of the ones from Donkey Kong 64? I dunno).</li>
	<li>Zero Suit most likely makes a return, not much to say—unique mechanics are always fun.</li>
	<li>Meta Knight and King Dedede likely return, as the only other members of the Kirby universe. Potentially one of them is replaced with another Kirby character (Prince Fluff is the only other character I can think of off the top of my head, having never owned a Kirby game), though I doubt that the two most recurring characters leave (certainly they both wouldn't).</li>
	<li>I was a little on the fence about Wolf. I left him as likely to return, but there is certainly potential to replace him with another Star Fox character (who, I don't know). Wolf does occupy one of the few villain slots, though, which adds a little to his staying power (for story/challenge purposes).</li>
	<li>I honestly think Lucas will be replaced with a different Earthbound character. Earthbound wouldn't lose a representative, but there are plenty of other characters that could take the second slot. I also somewhat doubt a third rep in addition to Lucas.</li>
	<li>I was also on the fence with ROB. The character they most "invented" for Melee, Mr. Game and Watch, stuck around, so he could make a comeback, but he may have been replaced as the "what the hell is this?" character by the Wii Fit Trainer.</li>
	<li>I don't think Snake makes a comeback—his huge array of projectiles role is fulfilled by Mega Man, and as the oddest inclusion in Brawl (he was specifically requested) and without any recent Nintendo titles (I think), I'm betting he's out.</li>
	<li>New characters: Mega Man (semi-replaces Snake), Rosalina (potentially replaces Wario), Villager, Wii Fit Trainer (potentially replaces ROB). If we play conservatively and say only Snake is dropped from the original cast (not counting the Pokemon/Fire Emblem updates), then we're at 38 characters, including 7 brand-new ones (counting Trainer as one) and room for 2-5 more. If you play cutthroat and drop Snake/Wario/ROB and replace Lucas, you have 36 characters, with 8 newcomers. This leaves more room for universes like Donkey Kong, Metroid, retro-Nintendo (a la Ice Climbers/Game and Watch/ROB), and Earthbound to pick up reps.</li>
</ul>
Without further ado, a crude drawing for your viewing pleasure. Click for big.

  <title>A discussion of "new" Team Fortress 2 weapons</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just recently I've been back playing TF2 and really realizing what fun some of the newer weapons are. Valve has gone on a bit of a spree with recent updates where they've updated the balance of older, not-oft-used or just bad weapons for the current state of TF2, making for some interesting matchups.

Scout primary weapons have undergone a pretty big overhaul. The Scattergun remains old reliable, the Force-a-Nature is still annoying and hard to use, the Shortstop still sort-of-kites. But the most recent two weapons have been essentially redone from scratch.

The Soda Popper used to charge up while the Scout was running and give him minicrits for a short period of time. It was killer for Scouts who could aim well and synergized well with the default pistol for racking up longer-ranged damage. It was sort of a jankety thing, though, you couldn't fire your primary weapon and save the charge, the minicrits activated as soon as the bar was full. It was weird, it did a thing that the Crit-a-Cola already did (but better), bleh.

After the remake, the boost can be stored (now activated with M2), and instead of minicrits the Scout gets 5 midair jumps for the duration of the boost. This makes it more of a fun weapon and less of a serious killer rampage fun-destroyer. Useful for reaching new places, for dancing around enemies, and generally being a blast. Does the DPS hold up? No, but the new utility is worth a shot.

The Baby Face's Blaster was always somewhat useful: it made the Scout faster with damage dealt, but didn't let him jump without seriously slowing him down. That's all been done away with. First, its combat abilities were reset to clone the Scattergun, minus two loaded shots. Then the base speed of the Scout, with 0 boost, was increased to only a 10% penalty -- piddly compared to the roughly 30% increase the Scout receives at full boost. Then the reduction was changed to take away only 25% of the bar on a jump, and only on air jumps. So, basically, if a Scout stays above a boost bar about 15% full (which is 15 damage, the break-even point) and deals 25 damage for every double-jump he performs, he only suffers in extended combat and gains a great deal of flexibility in moving between points, the cart, health packs, and enemies.

Most importantly, moving at 173% the speed of Pyros, Engineers, Snipers and Spies is exciting as shit.

As a quick note: the Crit-a-Cola was also changed to give the Scout +25% speed, +minicrits, and +10% damage taken while active. The more unlocks Scout gets, the more he can run and jump, and the stranger the class gets. Not sure how I feel about this one in particular.

The new Liberty Launcher, upgraded from its old 3-shot form, now has four fast rockets and protects the user from 25% of their rocket jumps, but you do 25% less damage. Whether or not I think this weapon is a crutch for people who can't shoot Scouts (hint: it totally is), it's really fun on open maps, particularly with the Gunboats, one of my favorite unlocks. This seems redundant but taking about 10 damage from an explosive jump can't be beat.

The new Cow Mangler, simplified from its old 5-shot form, now only has 4 attributes: ammoless, charge shot, 20% vs. buildings, no crits ever. This simplifies things a lot and also makes it a decent use-everywhere launcher now. The charge shot is still only marginally useful (but still neat), even though it's not the jumping king it once was.

The Battalion's Backup now gives the Soldier 220 health. This is really goofy but occasionally useful. The Concheror now gives the Soldier 2 health every second. This is really goofy and often useful, particularly for rocket jump play (pairs reasonably well with the new Liberty Launcher too). These changes were a bit out of the blue but anything for players to equip them again, I suppose.

The Diamondback now grants free crits for backstabs AND building destructions. This is really cool. I unfortunately can't aim Spy revolvers for shit but this is great when it works. Backstab the Engi, sap all his stuff, and suddenly you're looking at maybe 5 crits to protect yourself (or play aggressively with). Interesting to be sure -- it made me switch off stock revolver for the first time in a very long time.

The Short Circuit is now extremely fucking broken, which I suppose is one way to get your players to equip a difficult-to-use weapon. It now costs 5 per zap, can fire extremely quickly, can destroy all projectiles, and damages players. The damage was never the reason to use the gun but it's now become a way for an Engineer to run head-on at Soldiers and Demoman without fear: throw down a minisentry, shotgun perhaps, then charge in blindly spamming left click. You have shut down any non-shield Demoman and any non-shotgun Soldier, which is a reasonable percentage of players. If you were looking to use it as it was originally intended, as a nest protector, you're also in luck: easy as pie, piece of cake. Not exactly the most popular piece of metal but this weapon is out of control... and lots of fun to use while it lasts.

Crusader's Crossbow now passively reloads, like the flare guns, and is in general a much better put-together weapon, even if I have little use for it. Go crazy.

And this one isn't new, but can I just say hot damn I really really like the Loose Cannon and if the strange version were cheaper, I'd pick that up in a heartbeat. That thing is a pure fun machine.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I'm working on a small text-based fighting game called Manfighter, in which you fight mans. Because I like to program things like this, and because I like to talk about the things I program, I decided to put up a blog to keep track of my thoughts on the game as it progresses.

That blog can be found here: <a href="http://manfighter.wordpress.com/">http://manfighter.wordpress.com/</a>, and contains links to the GitHub page as well as a first post explaining the concept of the game and the direction I want to take it.

In the near future, there will be easily-playable release versions of the game in .jar format so more people can download it and give it a whirl. I'm hoping to work on it all throughout this semester, so stay tuned -- day-to-day updates will stay exclusively on the Manfighter blog but major releases / other profound topics will be crosslinked here. Thanks for checking it out!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The worry about Early Access games</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/the-worry-about-early-access-games/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me preface this by saying I don't want to come off as a worrywart, spoilsport, this-essay-deals-in-absolutes sort of guy. I'm not. It's not. This is just a collection of thoughts, loosely organized from a conversation with Dominic and a rant in the general direction of Cassie.

I want to start with a brief history of how games are made and sold. This is shortened from previous rants because you have the internet open <em>exactly now</em> and can find more about this than I can probably tell you succinctly. Also because I don't want to fact-check any of this because the importance of it is not the <em>absolutes</em>, but the <em>perception</em> of the industry (to a point). So take this with a small grain of salt. Or three.<em>
</em>

Back when the Nintendo was making game carts for the Super Nintendo, as a first example, they released a game and then it was done. Game development over. Maybe if you were really, really good and sold a shitload of copies, you very quietly released a new cart with a few subtle changes and perhaps a bugfix or two later in the game's lifecycle. <em>Maybe</em>. Being a video game tester was so completely out of the public conscious that it was almost legendary.

Sometime in the 90's the PC game industry started to take off. I'll use Age of Empires II as my example because that was a decent chunk of my childhood. If you wanted to play Age when it came out, you went to the game store and you bought the CD (which came with a sexy folding booklet) and played the game, and you could play online too. At some point, they released a patch to the game, which fixed the broken-ass Teutons and changed some other things, and you could either download the patch and apply it on your local machine (if you even knew about it!), or I think it was briefly available on CD separately. (If not for this game, then for others.) Then they released the Conquerors expansion, which included the patched game CD and the new Conquerors CD, which also changed some <em>more</em> things. So there are three different versions of the game kicking around now, and it is entirely likely a player has not heard of at least one of the variants.

This is a problem, ultimately. The separation between Conquerors and regular Age is fine, but the bugfixes and patches should be available to everyone, because they improve the experience and make the game better, yeah? And it was hard to do that.

Fast-forward to a game called Half-Life 2, which, when launched, had to be redeemed on Steam in order to play. Valve saw this problem, too, and wanted to fix it, slowly. There were several patches for Half-Life released over the years, each of which improved the game or fixed bugs or what-have-you, but it's important to understand two things:
<ol>
	<li>The game could have been considered "complete" on release, by older standards as well as updated standards. The remaining bugs did not detract from the game and everything that was meant to be present, was.</li>
	<li>By putting the game on Steam, that meant that 95% of your playerbase, perhaps even more, were all playing the <em>new</em>, patched version of the game <em>almost immediately after it was released</em>.</li>
</ol>
Patches on Steam are automatic, if your Steam is on and your internet connection is valid. So everyone who's not playing some game in offline mode is fully up-to-date, all of the time. This improves the experience! No longer do I have to hear about such a patch, download and read the installation instructions and install the patch and hope that tens or hundreds or thousands of other players have done the same.

Let me jump forward to 2007, when Team Fortress 2 was released as part of the Orange Box. This was a fun little class-based shooter game, long in the careful development and balance. It was released with 9 classes, each having about 3 weapons, and 6 maps. And it was fun! It worked well on release (for the most part: some of us still remember the needle-boosting bug that let Engineers build in the skybox) and was a complete game.

But that wasn't enough, and the game has evolved quite a lot in the six years since then. It's added a lot of weapons, each of which changed the gameplay in some way, as well as a shitton of new hats and more official and unofficial maps. Playing as the game has evolved this far has been a hell of a ride, and TF2 is still my most favorite online multiplayer game, bar none. But, again, it is important to note that the game <em>was considered complete on release</em>.

An argument that sometimes gets thrown around is: when is a game considered "done"? Is it the release date? Is it the game after all the bugfixes have been applied? Is it when all the DLC is out? Is it the GOTY edition? What's done? I want to use another example, Skyrim, as an example.

Skyrim on release, like most other Elder Scrolls titles, had some bugs, some of which were gamebreaking and could waste shitloads of time invested in a character (unless you played on PC and were super careful with your console commands). The four DLCs released did two things: gave the player more, unique options (customizing a house, crossbows, traveling to Morrowind, to name three) and gave the player generally better options at the start of the game, just because that's how the DLC tends to work to entice you to buy it.

To me, the complete Skyrim is the Legendary Edition I bought, which included all the DLC and most of the major problems fixed already. Because of the type of game at work here, and the limited development schedule (everything looks limited compared to TF2's nine-year development!), not everything could be solved, and now everything works fine and it's fine. But this isn't the launch game!

So what is an Early Access game? It's comparable to an "alpha" or "beta" game, whichever term you want, where a game is playable but the community acts as testers, showing support for an uncompleted game with their wallets. Most Early Access games are perfectly playable, but aren't finished. The developers are trying to gauge interest by releasing essentially a fancy tech demo, or they are actively working on a project and require more money to justify their expenses, or the game relies largely on human interaction (like Rust and DayZ) and is much better tested with humans interacting.

Which ends up being great for everyone involved. The players who like such-and-such developer, or like such-and-such genre of game, were more than likely going to purchase the game anyway (or would have at least considered it) and can now play it even sooner. The players who like "testing" (used very loosely) as well as being the "first" on the scene and enjoy playing games as they change and mature can now jump on that train before the game is even released, unlike before. And the developers, who are either looking for more money to continue development, a gauge of interest, or just attention (think Minecraft in particular, or even Rust) can do so. So everybody wins, right?

Well, maybe not. The worry is that a game like Rust, which is a fairly bare-bones game but still a unique experience, has already developed bitter players who like the game as it is. Just surfing around on a couple Rust threads tells me that plenty of players are content with getting a group of ten or so, going on to a random server, quickly helping each other get the best weapons/armor, and destroying everyone else around. Which, I mean, cool, the game lets you do that, fine.

But say that the guns are seen as too powerful. Or there opens up a much much larger variety of ways that lower players can defend themselves / fight back against the players with guns and armor. And the game changes, changes from "get the best items, destroy things" to a "find creative solutions for defense, traps-in-my-house-building" game. Plenty of the old players won't be happy.  Clearly the first version wasn't the final version. Things have changed.

And if it wasn't done the first time, well, why bother? Because it was fun in the interim? Valid. Because it required beta-testing to change the scope of the game? Valid. Because interest in the game was needed, either through word-of-mouth or monetary sales? Valid. But what if those changes <em>don't</em> get added, because of player backlash? Who's right? Both paths can be valid.

All this just makes a man like myself, who likes very much to purchase a complete, working, package with the vision of the original developers intact, worry very much about the validity of many an Early Access game.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So AirDroid is an app for Android phones that gives you a large amount of control over your Android phone from your computer over a wireless network. You can access photos, text people, and generally manipulate the phone in every way you could manipulate it normally, but with a keyboard and with native upload/download behavior, the most convenient of things.

You can also control the camera. Which, aside from being mostly pointless, is also sort of fun if you point it at the screen.

  <title>The Lego Movie might be the best "children's movie" ever</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/the-lego-movie-might-be-the-best-childrens-movie-ever/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a <strong>bold statement</strong> to make. I know it. Indulge me for a bit.

The Lego Movie would be a good movie even without any of the Lego bricks involved. The dialog is straightforward and witty and well-done, even for children. It's fast-paced but not a race. The wide cast of characters, including Batman and Dumbledore and Superman and Shaquille O'Neal, all bring their own flair to the movie that (importantly) isn't ever over-the-top. Even Batman, who builds a character around liking the color black and being super-cool, isn't 100% predictable and is funny throughout the movie.

But this is a movie about Legos, and takes fantastic advantage of it. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Some spoilers follow.</span></strong> Please go see the movie first.<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/spaceyness.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-383" alt="spaceyness" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/spaceyness.jpg?w=202" width="202" height="300" /></a>

The visual puns are everywhere. There are parodies and "ripoffs" of plenty of real-life things in Lego form. The construction workers build skyscrapers by following Lego instruction manuals. The main bad guy, President Business, collects objects "from another world" which are all real-life, non-Lego objects like a paper clip, an exacto knife, and others, including the main object of the evil plot, the Kragle (which is sheer brilliance).

Some parts of the story, particularly those being told as stories in-the-movie, have an even simpler style than the rest of the movie. Where most of the models are certainly possible with actual Lego bricks but complicated and thought-out and well-designed, the stories are animated with simple, square bricks only, which add to the feeling of "little-kids" while still communicating story very well. These parts are also narrated with silly little-kid sound effects, like the pirate ship that pbbbbbbs around like a motorbike, and it's hilarious and lends a great touch.

The concept of "the man upstairs" is introduced early on as a God metaphor, but eventually develops into something far more sinister, as the dual personality of President Business and the real-life child's no-nonsense father (Will Ferrell) comes into play towards the end. It's not even a twist, really, but a natural extension of what Legos should be all about: playing and creating.

In fact the concept of a Lego Masterbuilder is one of the main points of the movie. Masterbuilders can rebuild the world around them, possessing the creativity to manipulate bricks into whatever they like. When the main character, Emmett, meets a Masterbuilder, she escapes with him by building a giant rocket motorcycle out of an alleyway (that eventually transforms so that it can fly away from the police). When Masterbuilders start to visualize the pieces around them and what they can make, they identify pieces individually with numbers, which I can only assume are the actual catalog pieces numbers of the various Lego bricks (again, a great, subtle touch).

edit: I forgot to mention the ending again, which is something I'd vaguely thought about beforehand and was not disappointed in. They thought of everything.

The movie is all about creativity, and possibility, and transmits the sheer wonder and amazement any kid playing with Legos can find. The Lego Movie was exactly everything that I could hope for from something trying to embody my childhood, and it was that and much much more.

Oh, and if you're still not convinced, it features the voices of Will Ferrell (who I don't mind as a villain), Charlie Day (who is <strong>great</strong> as a hyperexcited 1980's spaceman), Liam Neeson (whose good cop/bad cop face-switching is hilarious, grounded in actual Lego pieces, and integral to the first half of the story), Morgan Freeman (fantastic as always), Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill (as superheroes), Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams (as C-3PO and Lando!), and of course Shaquille O'Neal as himself.

If you cheated and read this without watching the movie, firstly you're an idiot, secondly go watch it <em>right this minute</em>, thirdly once you've done that I dare you to tell me I'm wrong. Movie of the year. No doubt.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for a Spanish class of mine, we have to complete these "personalized projects" that show that we're interacting with the language. Since last semester, I've been gradually updating a small Java project, which randomly selects a known word and a known tense and tells you to conjugate it.

I had been hardcoding most of the data, which was unwieldy and generally awkward, so I separated it out into data files, compiled, and ran it. Worked great. I packaged the whole thing up, the jar and the data files, sent it to my classmates and my teacher, and called it a day.

For whatever reason, my professor couldn't run it on her computer, and without looking at it I couldn't diagnose it. She asked me to bring it in and show her on a laptop. No problem! Dropbox had already synced it to my netbook, so I brought it in and gave it a try.

Didn't work. Fuck. Why does this not work?

My main computer runs Windows 7. The netbook runs Ubuntu. Is this a filepath problem on Linux?

So I do a little research. Using "/" works for directories on all three major OSes. So that's not it. Why can't it find the files? I do a little rearranging, try to pack the text files in the jar file itself (hint: this is really hard and I can't figure it out), try some more jar packing, try some more launch configurations.

Eventually I figure it out. Java understands very clearly the concept of the "current working directory." This is the location that every file access is taken relative to. Windows and the Eclipse program and Linux all handle this <em>very very differently</em> and that's frustrating.

If you double-click a jar file in the file explorer in Windows, it will set the current working directory to the location from which it was launched. This is smart! because it lets you place files in the same directory and know where they are at all times.

If you double-click a jar in Eclipse, it sets the current working directory to the Eclipse home directory. This is silly. The Eclipse home directory doesn't have anything in it that I want. Why is this a thing?

If you double-click a jar in Ubuntu, it sets the current working directory to the home directory, e.g. /home/sam. This is slightly understandable but still silly and annoying. Linux does not change the current working directory (apparently) unless you navigate there using the terminal: using the GUI is not enough. If you navigate to the jar file in Ubuntu and run it using command-line, it runs perfectly and sets the working directory appropriately, because, well, you've gone and changed it.

So, because Java specifically does NOT allow you to change the working directory (per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/840190/changing-the-current-working-directory-in-java">here</a> and <a href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4045688">here</a>), and because there is NO easy (non-hacky) way to get the location from which you launched a jar file, and because I CANNOT for the life of me figure out how to properly pack the data files into the jar and access them normally (apparently File doesn't work, but some refactor of my code would perhaps), the workaround is to include a readme file, which describes all this in less detail and with less coarse language.

Hours of effort for a bug that ultimately plagued only myself, as I doubt that of the subset of people in my Spanish class that will use such a program (which is tiny), any of them will be running Linux. I have no idea if the same problem troubles Mac users. I suspect using the terminal to launch it will ensure correct behavior, but as for plain double-clicks? Who knows.

I suppose it was worth it to learn this knowledge. I'm not actually sure of that one yet.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a heads-up, known to those of you following me on Twitter: I scanned bits and pieces of my childhood notebooks and am getting the best of the best and posting them to another blog, along with some names and concepts and other things I wrote up back in my creative heyday.

You can follow that blog separately over at <a href="http://notebookdrawings.wordpress.com/">http://notebookdrawings.wordpress.com/</a> if you're interested (or follow the link up top), I won't post about it much here.

And just a friendly reminder, the Manfighter Dev Log (link also above) is still alive and kicking, progress is slow and steady!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Sam reads the World-Herald</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's news is interesting so I felt like writing a bit about it.

Lots of talk about the Pope, who's now been the Pope for a year, and what this means for Catholics and the general religious everywhere. A generous portion of my family is Catholic, and though I can't say I believe in anything myself I think the fact that Francis is being more open and conscientiously opening discussion on things that have been set in stone for so long is a step in the right direction.

<a href="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/larry-and-doug.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-398" alt="larry and doug" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/larry-and-doug.jpg" width="513" height="337" /></a>Doug McDermott's Sports Illustrated cover, which is a remake of an old Larry Bird Sports Illustrated cover, is really well done: even the title of the article is the same. It's interesting that they showed Doug's feet (they didn't show Larry's) and had him cover the magazine name, which makes him look an awful lot taller. It's also interesting how much uniform shapes have changed (I like the old look better, but I think that's just me).

The article about Pastor Mike, who attended both Creighton's Senior Night (in which McDermott exploded and hit the 3000 career points mark) as well as Nebraska's defeat of Wisconsin (all but clinching an NCAA spot for the first time in 16 years) was excellent. Full of biblical jokes and things, but chilling, in a way: really, that was a heck of a weekend for basketball, and for the state in general. These things don't happen every year.

The GOP is as per usual staunchly defending their views on abortion, and are apparently planning to make social issues in general a more major part of the platform come the 2016 race. I think it's a bunch of hooey, and I think the GOP will keep losing support and interest (and power) if they keep on like this.

Obama and the Ukrainian Prime Minister met. Basically everyone but Russia wants Russia out of Crimea. I won't lie and say that the situation doesn't worry me a bit, because it does! I'm not old enough to remember when Russia was legitimately scary and this is a step in that direction, despite the hugely changed world. I hope that this works out as cleanly as possible. I'm glad I'm not in politics.

All the Nebraska DMVs are going to shut down for four days in April so their employees can be trained on new licensing rules. I don't know if this has happened recently but anyone with a cool 16th birthday in April who wants their permit is going to have to wait!

Jackie Gaughan passed away. I'll be perfectly honest, I didn't know very much about the man before this article. His name is on the Multicultural Center attached to the UNL Union, and I've only ever been there for quiz bowls and occasional soap carving meetings, nothing cultural or multicultural at all. Apparently his grandson donated some large sum of money to have his name put on it when it was built, it wasn't strictly an honorary thing (which I had always figured). Still, interesting to read.

The SAT is getting even easier. Whether this is to compete with the ACT or just to be less imposing, the changes still read as the continuance of "everybody's a winner, everyone does well, everyone can go to college and be super successful." I'm not a test maker but yeesh.

Erin Grace still has a weird smile.

People think there aren't enough women protagonists in movies. They might be right. People think that male-led movies make more money. They're generally wrong, it's dependent on budget alone apparently. So why the disconnect? All I can offer is a shrug and an "Iunno" and a "that's how it's been and change is hard."

Europe wants to stop United States from using names like "Parmesan" and "feta" and "Gorgonzola" to describe their cheeses. Parmesan cheese is supposed to come from Parma, Italy. Feta is from Greece (just because it always <em>has</em> been). Other cheeses, like Muenster and Asiago and Romano, as well as other terms like Greek yogurt, bologna, and prosciutto are under fire. This sounds pretty asinine. If you serve a Philly cheesesteak in Germany, you deserve to call it a Philly <em>because that's what it is</em>.

That's all for today!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Two links: the survivor of an SR-71 accident and a giant nuclear fusion reactor</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The first: http://roadrunnersinternationale.com/weaver_sr71_bailout.html

This one is relatively short. Bill Weaver, a test pilot for the SR-71 Blackbird in 1966, survived a forced ejection from the plane... because it ripped itself to pieces while traveling over Mach 3.

The second: http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/03/03/140303fa_fact_khatchadourian?currentPage=all

This one is relatively long, but fantastically written. It details the story of ITER, a multinational group of scientists working to build what would be the world's largest and only self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactor. Fission is the principle every other nuclear reactor operates on: fusion is much more difficult, and has never been done on a large enough scale to generate more energy than is required to start it. The entire thing smacks of over-complications<span style="line-height:1.5em;">, mad-scientist architectures, grandiose visions of the future, and if it were to succeed, the eventual solution to the continuing energy crisis.</span>

ITER has been a thing since Reagan and Gorbachev in the 80s, and their end-goal, which is essentially a tiny nuclear cloud, like a star, in a giant magnetic bottle, is a distant dream. Still, this is one of the most inspirational things I've read in a long long time. It makes everything else in the world seem smaller and less important in comparison. Well worth your time investment.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Tunnel Walk of shame is a website run by a big Husker fan who likes to take the players and coaches through a image/text journey every time there's a game coming up. It's generally funny stuff, particularly for those who understand Husker football culture reasonably well.

Well, in the spirit of the basketball team's trip to the tournament, he decided to make fun of all them too, and it's incredible.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[[I was linked to this at the following address: <a href="http://lpix.org/sslptest/index.php?id=224">http://lpix.org/sslptest/index.php?id=224</a> which is apparently a snapshot of an older site, linked on the page. The text is short enough that I'm going to post it here, as well. The story is credited to <span style="color:#000000;">Mark Rosenfelder.]</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Roger and Ann needed to meet Sergey in San Francisco. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“Should we take a train, or a steamship, or a plane?” asked Ann. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“Trains are too slow, and the trip by steamship around South America would take months,” replied Roger. “We’ll take a plane.” </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">He logged onto the central network using his personal computer, and waited while the system verified his identity. With a few keystrokes he entered an electronic ticketing system, and entered the codes for his point of departure and his destination. In moments the computer displayed a list of possible flights, and he picked the earliest one. Dollars were automatically deducted from his personal account to pay for the transaction. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">The planes left from the city airport, which they reached using the city bi-rail. Ann had changed into her travelling outfit, which consisted of a light shirt in polycarbon-derived artifical fabric, which showed off her pert figure, without genetic enhancements, and dark blue pants made of textiles. Her attractive brown hair was uncovered. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">At the airport Roger presented their identification cards to a representative of the airline company, who used her own computer system to check his identity and retrieve his itinerary. She entered a confirmation number, and gave him two passes which gave them access to the boarding area. They now underwent a security inspection, which was required for all airline flights. They handed their luggage to another representative; it would be transported in a separate, unpressurized chamber on the aircraft. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“Do you think we’ll be flying on a propeller plane? Or one of the newer jets?” asked Ann. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“I’m sure it will be a jet,” said Roger. “Propeller planes are almost entirely out of date, after all. On the other hand, rocket engines are still experimental. It’s said that when they’re in general use, trips like this will take an hour at most. This one will take up to four hours.” </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">After a short wait, they were ushered onto the plane with the other passengers. The plane was an enormous steel cylinder at least a hundred meters long, with sleek backswept wings on which four jet engines were mounted. They glanced into the front cabin and saw the two pilots, consulting a bank of equipment needed the fly the plane. Roger was glad that he did not need to fly the plane himself; it was a difficult profession which required years of training. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">The surprisingly large passenger area was equipped with soft benches, and windows through which they could look down at the countryside as they flew 11 km high at more than 800 km/h. There were nozzles for the pressurized air which kept the atmosphere in the cabin warm and comfortable despite the coldness of the stratosphere. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“I’m a little nervous,” Ann said, before the plane took off. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“There’s nothing to worry about,” he assured her. “These flights are entirely routine. You’re safer than you are in our ground transport cars!” </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Despite his calm words, Roger had to admit to some nervousness as the pilot took off, and the land dropped away below them. He and the other passengers watched out the windows for a long time. With difficulty, he could make out houses and farms and moving vehicles far below. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“There are more people going to San Francisco today than I would have expected,” he remarked. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“Some of them may in fact be going elsewhere,” she answered. “As you know, it’s expensive to provide airplane links between all possible locations. We employ a hub system, and people from smaller cities travel first to the hub, and then to their final destination. Fortunately, you found us a flight that takes us straight to San Francisco.” </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">When they arrived at the San Francisco airport, agents of the airline company helped them out of their seats and retrieved their luggage, checking the numeric tags to ensure that they were given to the right people. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“I can hardly believe we’re already in another city,” said Ann. “Just four hours ago we were in Chicago.” </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">“We’re not quite there!” corrected Roger. “We’re in the airport, which is some distance from the city, since it requires a good deal of space on the ground, and because of occasional accidents. From here we’ll take a smaller vehicle into the city.” </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">They selected one of the hydrocarbon-powered ground transports from the queue which waited outside the airport. The fee was small enough that it was not paid electronically, but using portable dollar tokens. The driver conducted his car unit into the city; though he drove only at 100 km/hr, it felt much faster since they were only a meter from the concrete road surface. He looked over at Ann, concerned that the speed might alarm her; but she seemed to be enjoying the ride. A game girl, and intelligent as well! </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">At last the driver stopped his car, and they had arrived. Electronic self-opening doors welcomed them to Sergey’s building. The entire trip had taken less than seven hours.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Super Smash Bros. Brawl tourney, partial results</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My floor had a huge Brawl tourney over last semester and the beginning of this semester. We crowned a champion a while ago and I said I'd try and pull some stats from the data files, out of curiosity. Well, here we are, months later, and I'm finally getting around to it.

Here's the first installment: a compilation of all the characters played in all the matches during the round robin (regular season play). The three numbers are thus: number of times chosen at character select, number of times received from random, total games played. Some notes follow.
<ol>
	<li>Sheilda - 72 - 2 - 74</li>
	<li>Link - 49 - 5 - 54</li>
	<li>Ike - 47 - 7 - 54</li>
	<li>Samus - 30 - 8 - 38</li>
	<li>Lucas - 29 - 7 - 36</li>
	<li>Captain Falcon - 33 - 3 - 36</li>
	<li>Kirby - 28 - 6 - 34</li>
	<li>Pit - 27 - 5 - 32</li>
	<li>Toon Link - 26 - 3 - 29</li>
	<li>Falco - 23 - 3 - 26</li>
	<li>ROB - 20 - 5 - 25</li>
	<li>Mr. Game and Watch - 21 - 1 - 22</li>
	<li>Ganondorf - 21 - 0 - 21</li>
	<li>Snake - 14 - 6 - 20</li>
	<li>Wolf - 17 - 2 - 19</li>
	<li>Donkey Kong - 10 - 8 - 18</li>
	<li>Mario - 14 - 3 - 17</li>
	<li>Lucario - 14 - 1 - 15</li>
	<li>Peach - 8 - 6 - 14</li>
	<li>Ness - 6 - 7 - 13</li>
	<li>Zero Suit Samus - 12 - 0 - 12</li>
	<li>Pikachu - 7 - 4 - 11</li>
	<li>Luigi - 5 - 6 - 11</li>
	<li>Yoshi - 9 - 1 - 10</li>
	<li>Fox - 6 - 2 - 8</li>
	<li>King Dedede - 4 - 4 - 8</li>
	<li>Pokemon Trainer - 4 - 3 - 7</li>
	<li>Diddy Kong - 3 - 4 - 7</li>
	<li>Marth - 3 - 4 - 7</li>
	<li>Olimar - 3 - 4 - 7</li>
	<li>Wario - 0 - 7 - 7</li>
	<li>Jigglypuff - 4 - 2 - 6</li>
	<li>Sonic - 2 - 4 - 6</li>
	<li>Bowser - 4 - 1 - 5</li>
	<li>Ice Climbers - 1 - 4 - 5</li>
	<li>Meta Knight - 0 - 3 - 3</li>
</ol>
Some notes:
<ul>
	<li>I didn't separate Sheik and Zelda matches when I first started keeping track, because the people that were playing switched often enough that they blurred together, and once I thought about it more it was too late to change it. In hindsight, I ought to have distinguished between games where only one fighter was used vs. both. A nontrivial portion of the Sheilda population is due to a couple Zelda-only players.</li>
	<li>Ganondorf didn't come up on Random, ever. Which is funny.</li>
	<li>Neither did Zero Suit Samus, but of course she can't (which is silly). All 12 ZSS matches are from the same person.</li>
	<li>No one picked Wario, ever. In fact most of the high-tier characters (Diddy Kong, Pikachu, Marth, Wario, Ice Climbers, Olimar) are in the bottom half of the graph. Just goes to show which characters are generally more fun, I think.</li>
	<li>I was the only person who ever chose Jigglypuff (all 4 selections are mine). I dunno, she's fun, but apparently I'm in the minority.</li>
	<li>Meta Knight was banned from character selection, but not from Random, just to be funny about it.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>One week until the summer.</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/one-week-until-the-summer/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I almost beat another semester of college. I don't usually make mopey dopey posts like this but lots of things are changing and I want to talk about them a bit.

Next week I'm taking four tests: a Spanish test that I almost don't need to take, which I have been almost given the answers to; a physics test, which I do not feel adequately prepared for and am willing to accept a moderate grade on in order to get a B and leave; a calculus test, which I will continue to study for, but will be relatively straightforward (which will finish a math minor); and a computer science test, which I believe I understand well enough to slip through, particularly considering my performance on the other two exams.

Then I move all my junk from college into a family friend's house, here in Lincoln, where I've finally found a computer science internship. In fact I'll be working for Hudl, who is well-known for doing good work and being very laid-back in their work environment and directly preparing interns for real jobs because, well, they're working real jobs.

If you had asked me maybe three months ago if I'd be working for Hudl over the summer, I'd have told you "hell no." I never thought they'd show interest in a guy like myself, who has experience limited to a classroom for the most part, and no easy way to demonstrate his relatively strong people skills. But the Hudl interview process was very well put together, was a measure not only of what I had already learned but of my capacity to learn more, and indeed was the only company to extend me an offer.

Granted, when they offered me a job I mostly quit applying to other places. Two other companies subsequently turned me down, one after two lengthy phone interviews (vaguely reasonably well done) and one incredibly awkward phone interview (not every engineer is also good at talking to people, though he was good at talking about SQL). Didn't matter. My short-term dream, my ideal summer, had come together. Which was really neat.

This will be the first time I'll be staying somewhere that isn't my house or a dorm, where people generally take care of me. I'm not going to say I'm not nervous, both for a challenging job and for living on my own (sort of). Because I am.

After the summer ends, I'll be moving into an apartment with three of my friends from college. Which should be interesting. If things go well this summer with Hudl, I'll stay on during the year working part-time. The current plan is to knock out my language requirement (with one Spanish class) and my physics minor (with an astronomy class and lab) in one swoop.

So here we go.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Buying a new desktop</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My old laptop is hitting it hard, and with the eventual move to an apartment with a bigger desk, I decided to build a new computer for myself, as a good-job-saving-your-paychecks reward. Just wanted to briefly talk about it here, since I think I got a pretty good deal on it and it was fun to put together. A friend of mine knew what to look for and was generally very helpful and good company; good job Tom.

I already had a monitor / keyboard / mouse so those weren't an issue, which helped, but I put together a pretty quick rig for about $700, which was perfectly reasonable (and is relatively easy to expand in the future).

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16811352032">The case</a> was honestly just a regular bargain case that the motherboard would fit in. It was a tight fit but it works fine. I didn't need no damn flashy case, nor would I want to order anything but black, given the chance.

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16813130710">The motherboard</a> I understand less about. According to some sources on the internet, it has a good cost/power ratio, and is relatively modern. I also may have gotten some deal on it; it's currently out of stock which makes me think there was some special going on.

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16814487025">The graphics card</a> is (if I remember right) the same card Tom has in his case (or perhaps a model newer). Again, good cost/power ratio. New cards are always overpriced and old cards, well, are old. Thus far it plays every game I've tried on maximum settings (Crysis 2 being the most significant, but it ran on all Ultra settings!).

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16817171046">The power supply</a> is a power supply. It specifically is about 1.5x the power consumption of everything in the box, and that's really it.

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16819116895">The CPU</a> computes things and doesn't afraid of anything. I don't know a lot about these numbers either. This and the motherboard were the difficult ones.

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16820148694">The SSD</a> stores things. SSDs are the way of the future, and it's seriously noticeable how quick it is. Windows boots in seconds here where it can take twenty minutes to uncork itself on my big laptop. It's not huge but I don't need the space yet and storage is always getting cheaper (and can be increased without any real problems).

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16820231314">The RAM</a> is big. I don't think there is much finesse to purchasing RAM. You just want more of it. The motherboard has room for twice as much as is in it now, so this is again easily upgradeable.

My first, big Asus laptop I named "George," sarcastically, because my dad made fun of me when I first got it in the vein of Lenny from Of Mice and Men, or really the abominable snowman from Looney Tunes (specifically the quote "and I will hug him and squeeze him and call him George!"). When I got my netbook, George Jr. (or most accurately george-jr, no spaces or periods allowed) was the most obvious next name. So what's the name of this new desktop, the fastest thing I've owned?

King George.]]></content:encoded>

I don't really consider myself a League-r, but I'll hop on for a couple games of ARAM now and again. I love playing Lux, day or night. (And I recently bought Ziggs, who is almost as fun.)

In this game, out of all 12 people, I died the least, did the most total damage, had the biggest killing streak (8), and generally had a fucking blast. It wasn't a blowout, not until towards the end (and they always are towards the end).

Sometime soon I'll post an update on my fresh new job that I'm almost two weeks deep in!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I'm staying home from work today due to a serious sickness. It's been a while since I've felt this sick -- unable to stand properly, sore all over, nose running like a faucet, the works. And with Hearthstone down, I figure this is as good a time as any to talk about my job and the summer in general.

Working at Hudl has been a reasonably positive experience the entire month or so I've been here. Almost everyone at the office is a really cool person, easy to get along with, straight shooters everywhere. Work is managed well and everyone seems to know what they're doing, or at least where things are going.

I got a little unlucky when I first started up in that the section of the company I was going to be doing QA for had a serious lack of developers for some time: one had a kid, one had (has) a sick family, and one was helping the dev intern get his feet wet. So I won't lie and say I wasn't super bored for quite a while. I helped other people when I could, but it was a slow time.

With things being rearranged and more and more people joining the team every week, things have picked up reasonably, and everything is going fine. QA is fine. It's definitely not the "throw-it-over-the-wall" mentality, every team is deeply involved with every aspect of their own team's work. I appreciate my role in the squad. It is necessary and I have done just fine, in my own opinion.

Tell you what, though, it's not glamorous.

I knew this going in, of course. If you had asked me around the turn of the calendar year if I'd be working at Hudl in the summer, I'd have told you no way in hell. The fact that I'm here at all is brilliant. But I know now for sure that quality assurance is not something I pine for.

Which is fine. We can't all love our jobs. And really it's not bad. I'm not miserable. I'm not even unhappy. Hudl has done a lot for me, in handing me a job and a temporary housing stipend and lunches and a cast of great characters.

But if I was picking my dream job, it wouldn't be QA. It might be development. It really might be design, which sounds so hokey to a lot of people but really intrigues me. Truthfully I'm not sure what pushes all my buttons quite yet. I have time.

As of yesterday, the summer was officially 1/3 over, for me, at least in terms of how I think of things. I moved into the house I'm staying at for the summer on May 9th, and I move into my apartment for the school year on August 9th. So, one month down. Sure, there's a week or something before school starts after the August date, but it's scary realizing that summer is really quick.

I'm reasonably sure that I'll be able to continue working at Hudl part-time through the school year, it seems to have been mentioned plenty already but nothing's been set in stone. And I aim to do that -- I think it'll help to have some pressure in my limited time working there, instead of having gobs of unstructured time in between tests. And somebody's gotta pay my rent.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, at Hudl, the team is split up into squads of 8 or so, and every morning our squad does what's called a "stand-up," where we stand in a circle and talk about what we worked on the day before and what we're going to be working on today. It's just a quick opportunity to stay up-to-date on what everyone's doing.

One of my coworkers has been trying to, if he remembers, play the beginning of the Ludacris song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZG7IK99OvI">Stand Up</a>. Which is great, but it devolves into rap or whatever pretty quickly, so the effect is limited. So, on company time because company-related work, I made a short version that just loops the opening 8 seconds or so.

You can grab that <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19978518/Stand%20Up%20Loop.mp3">here</a>. That's in my Dropbox, so it won't be there forever, but you can always email me if you're really curious. I'm pretty happy with how it came out.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Final Results of the Steam Summer Sale</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Chuck's Challenge 3D: It's certainly not Chip's Challenge, but in a lot of ways that's a good thing. The graphics aren't always on-par in terms of readability (and are occasionally just weird and incorrect) but the game itself is basically Chip's Challenge++ and I'm okay with that. Easy to drop in and out of.

Pac-Man Championship Edition: What an interesting game. It really has nothing at all to do with Pac-Man. Well it sort of does. You chomp around and collect dots and fruit as they appear, and periodically find a power pellet and go to town on the sometimes 50+ ghosts that are trailing you. It's a fast-paced arcade-type game.

Monaco I honestly haven't done much with yet -- it seems like it's a lot better suited to local co-op or playing with friends. At least in the first few levels, which was all I tried at first, it doesn't explain the rules very well. Might have to come back to this one with someone else in the room.

Borderlands 2, GOTY. Bought it mostly so I could play with friends. I wasn't the biggest fan ever of the first one -- clunky interface and a big empty world. This game, as far as I can tell thus far, doesn't change much of that, but Borderlands was always 1000% better with friends. Also, just in case you didn't know, the GOTY comes with <em>most</em> of the major DLCs, not all -- you miss out on the extra cosmetic stuff for your character as well as (I think) the last DLC giving you extra levels for your character.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive: Saw it on sale, was curious about it. A coworker summed up CS for me really well: "play gun game and deathmatch like a casual, have fun." That's most of what I've done so far and it's a blast. I don't have a lot of desire to get into the competitive modes, but it's a change-up from TF2 or Borderlands or what have you.

Crimsonland: A twin-stick shooter, remade from its original version for Steam and 2014. It's fun. I like it. I wish the stick controls were slightly different -- you have to actually pull the trigger to shoot, which feels really awkward, and you can't aim at all long-range. Keyboard + mouse feels way better, which kind of goes against the whole twin-stick philosophy. It has lots of co-op potential though, and plenty of content in weapons and skills and missions.

Less than $30 all told. Not bad.]]></content:encoded>

On the other hand, I'm not a fan of seeing the street I live on blocked on both sides:

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So today I was at Barnes and Noble, doing the thing that I always do -- looking at the World War II books, because I'm a big fan of WWII stuff. I was mostly just browsing when a girl who was looking at books down the aisle came up and said hi.

She asked if I'd read any of the books up there, and if I had a favorite. I pointed out <em>Flyboys</em>, which might be my second-favorite book (behind Ender's Game), <em>The Pacific War</em>, which I haven't read all the way through but is one of the most complete sources about the USA-Japan conflict, and <em>Band of Brothers</em>, which was the book that they made an HBO series out of.

She seemed genuinely interested, told me she liked history but preferred Civil War-era stuff, which there aren't quite as many books written about. She asked where I was going to school, I told her, and she said she was actually going to school in South Dakota and was just down for the week visiting family.

We chit-chatted for just a bit longer before she said see ya, and thanks. It was really nice to have a brief, friendly conversation with someone. I hope that happens again.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This does have a specific long-term purpose, and no I'm not telling you what it is. Suffice to say it's entirely too enormous for me to probably complete.

Regardless. This map shows all 73 NCAA D-1A (the FBS) schools in an automatically-qualifying conference as of 2013 (check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Qualifying_conference">Wikipedia's page</a> for more information), with some semi-arbitrary paths between schools of the same conference. The Big Ten is red, the Pac-12 is green, the ACC is blue, the AAC is yellow, the Big 12 is orange, and the SEC is purple. (And Notre Dame is black, but screw them.)

I switched Rutgers and Maryland just because I know off the top of my head that they're switching to the Big Ten come the 2014 season (thought the basis is a year old). I didn't check any other schools.

Hopefully I'll talk more about this in a while.

  <title>Dissecting Pocket Battles</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/pocket-battles.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-466" src="http://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/pocket-battles.jpg?w=300" alt="pocket-battles" width="300" height="300" /></a>So Pocket Battles is this nifty little board game that's contained within a small box. It's a two-player strategy game: you set up your armies individually, deploy them on the battlefield, and pit them against each other by moving them around and rolling dice. It's fairly quick and pretty fun, and there are 4 boxes (with 2 armies apiece) which makes for a lot of mix-and-match battles.

Something that I really like doing with board games, and dice games in particular, is trying to crack them. What are the odds of xyz happening, what's the average performance? I've done this previously with <a href="https://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/bored-games-and-my-family/">Six Cubes</a> and to a point with <a href="https://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/standard-risk-vs-italian-risk-or-why-math-is-difficult/">Risk</a> (and I've done a little not-talked-about work with Parcheesi and Yahtzee, which I'll have to talk about someday). Pocket Battles is a game full of variables and odds, and it was a challenge to come up with something I could work into something I could use.

In the future I'd like to put the algorithm I used on GitHub, because GitHub is a neat place and I hope that someone else on the internet can use my code, as I stole and rearranged it from the internet. For now I just want to briefly talk about what the algorithm can do, and a couple questions I had.

<strong><i>How good can a charging unit get based on attack dice alone?</i></strong> The only special trait the algorithm really takes into account is +x Wounds, which apply extra wounds <em>only</em> if you land a hit, which doesn't affect hitchance obviously but makes your bottom line damage look a lot better. So what's the tradeoff between +wounds and just +targets?

Let's consider the Orcs, who can make a Unit [Bugbear + Standard Bearer + 2 Gnolls] with 4/4/5/6 targets, 4 dice on a charge, and +2 wounds; if you switch out one troop [Gnolls for Orcs], you get 3/4/4/5/6 targets but only +1 wound. How do these units compare? We'd like to look at the probability that we'll do ANY damage -- consistency is always good -- and we'd like to look at our most likely outcome as well as our last wound target before we fall below 50% likelihood, so we can try and guess whether our unit will kill an enemy unit.

[all percentages are rounded off, for those keeping score at home.]

The first unit, which has two Gnolls, has a 94% chance of dealing any damage at all (and the minimum is 3, so that's where the scale starts). The most likely outcome is 4 damage, with a 25% occurrence (though 5 damage has a 24% occurrence, so you have nearly a 50% chance of dealing 4 or 5 damage), and we will deal at LEAST 5 damage 52% of the time.

Those are some sweet numbers. Let's swap out a Gnoll for an Orc, which gives us another die target but removes a +1 wound, and try again.

This new unit, with an Orc, has a 99% chance of dealing any damage at all, the minimum being 2 here. The most likely outcome is 4 damage, with a 28% chance, followed by 5 damage, with a 25% chance, so more than 50% of all outcomes will deal 4 or 5 damage. We have a 72% chance of dealing at least 4 damage (before falling off to dealing at least 5 at 44%). What does this mean?

It means that the Orc unit is more consistent at dealing wounds at all, but the double-Gnoll unit deals more wounds when it hits. The difference between 99% and 94% doesn't feel large, but that difference only gets larger the fewer dice you have -- if, for example, you receive a wound and your Standard Bearer goes down (losing you one die), the double Gnoll unit now only hits 88% of the time vs. the Orc unit hitting 96% of the time.

<strong><i>Does the Confederacy have any advantages over the Union in long-range weapons?</i></strong> As the first box I played with, I got a lot of experience with it, and it's interesting how unfair it can feel. The Napoleon Gun, a Union rifle, can shoot almost anywhere on the battlefield and can be paired with a Captain for 3 dice against targets of 4/5/6. Its counterpart, the Confederate Withworth, costs 1 more and has 5/6/6 targets (though still 3 dice when paired with a Lieutenant).

Seems like the Union gun would be much more consistent, and you'd be right: it deals at least 1 damage 88% of the time and at least 2 damage 50% of the time, where the Withworth only lands at least 1 hit 70% of the time and at least 2 48% of the time, both less than the Napoleon Gun. It's not until you to 3 and beyond that the Withworth picks up, but it's only a 20% chance of dealing 3 or more wounds. The important stat here is the first one -- you generally can't afford to have your backline miss.

The Confederates have another backline rifle, though: the Parrot Rifle, which has no Wide Arc trait but regains 4/5/6 targets and has +1 wound. What's its stats? You roll one less die (we're assuming paired with the Lieutenant again), so that's a first strike, but does this ruin it? Odds of landing a hit (at least 2 damage) are 75%. This is neat and all, but remember the Napoleon Gun basically splits this percentage between its 1 and 2 wound hits (88% and 50%; this is not an exact data point) and retains Wide Arc, which the Parrot Rifle could really use.

What if the Confederates get the first shot with the Ordnance Rifle (plus Lieutenant)? This has 4/5/6/6 targets, but no long-range trait, and thus is unlikely to see a lot of serious action, but we're bold and theoretical here. Still at a 75% hit rate, same as the Parrot Rifle. Indeed, the Ordnance Rifle is less effective than the Napoleon Gun as both 1 and 2-wound points, and is only slightly higher once you hit 3 wounds (14% vs. 13%). And it's on the front lines, getting destroyed.

What about Union's other guns? They're both 5/6 targeting, 4-dice-rolling frontline units (and thus vulnerable), but what if <em>they</em> go first? Odds of them landing at least 1 wound are 80%, and their 2-wound-or-more stat is only a percentage point lower at 41% than the Ordnance's 42%. Oh, and did I mention that <em>they don't even need the Captain to do this.</em> Truthfully, the Union's artillery outstrips the Confederacy in almost every way, unless you're particularly lucky with your rolls.

<em><strong>So what about this algorithm?</strong></em> I'm hoping to scan the cards here soon and get some simple GUI yoinked up, so I (or you) don't have to type numbers in manually anymore. The only trait I want to add special support for is the Orcs' Blood Lust trait, which is interesting. Basically, this should be a tool to guide your army-building, based on percentages, though you can usually remember that, in general, targets add reliability, +wounds add high-end damage, and extra dice do a bit of both. Check back later for the algorithm itself, if I clean it up, and more pictures and talking.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[What an... interesting game, with a great finish. Couple notes:

The band played Everything is Awesome, the song from the Lego Movie, during the 3rd quarter. That was neat.

Westerkamp had another crazy one-handed catch, and he laid himself out for a third but that one got called back on a penalty. I think Westercatch is a real nickname now. As long as he never returns punts.

My dad texted me, "AMEER FOR PRESIDENT!!" directly after the end of the game, and it made me laugh a lot.

Finally, a super-serious analysis / post-game short video of condolence from si.com, click <a href="http://www.si.com/college-football/video/2014/09/06/nebraska-cornhuskers-escape-mcneese-state">here.</a>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Sparq camp!</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2014/09/17/sparq-camp/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I got to go through a Sparq camp! I've had to explain this to a few people, so I'll break it down:

The NFL does this thing called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_scouting_combine">NFL scouting combine</a>, and it's a week-long event where invited players (aka the cream of the incoming draft class) get invited to test their strength, speed, and agility in measurable ways. It's something that NFL teams, and the public, use to rank athletes, and while it's not the final say in who's good, it certainly helps competition.

Nike does this thing called a <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/us-football/sparq">Sparq camp</a>, which is similar but much smaller and for high schoolers (and 7th / 8th graders), and it consists of four events: a 40-yard dash, a run-left, run-right, run-left agility test, a kneeling medicine ball throw, and a vertical jump. It's partially to track your improvement, partially to show to colleges, and partially to rank yourself across all high school athletes, which Nike does with some form of ranking.

Hudl, who partners with Nike to get Sparq data on up their website for athletes who have completed these camps, decided to coordinate one of these camps in-house, just for a little friendly competition. So I jumped for it!

I don't remember my stats exactly. My 40-yard dash was around 5.2 seconds, I think. My agility score was worse, closer to 6 (and in my defense, I didn't have cleats). I don't even remember the ball toss. It was miserable. But I managed to get 27 inches on the vertical leap, which is just slightly below the apparent average of 27.3 inches measured from all of last year's camps. In fact, it's only half an inch lower than Clay Matthews' score when he went through the camp [same link above]. That's sort of cool.

I'm really curious how I did relative to the other Hudlies. Not first, I know that, but I'm curious where I am. If being a goalie did nothing else for me in life, at least it let me jump okay.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First, I want to express how happy I am that Nebraska beat Miami. I would have rather lost to McNeese (on principle) than lose to Miami.

Second, I knew that Ameer Abdullah was really good, but this game could be a season-defining performance. His total dominance and inability to be tackled were legendary, and carried the Huskers to victory.

Third, there was a Miami fan sitting at the very front of my part of the student section, and while he wasn't exactly being quiet, he still put up with a hell of a lot of abuse from a couple drunk guys a few rows behind me. I gave him a "good game" as I was leaving and I think he appreciated it.

Fourth, a brief story: after Miami took the field and the game was almost ready to start, two banners popped up in the South student section: one saying "WELCOME" and another with the Miami U logo.

This was interesting. I don't know if we've ever welcomed anyone quite so graciously -- we clap for their starters but that's about it.

Then the U disappeared, and I'll let this picture show what popped up in its place:

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've never seen anything exactly like this, so I decided to make one. Follow the path of your favorite characters through four games and four systems.

In retrospect, a circular design might have been easier to stomach. Or a vertical design. I'm not a designer. Regardless. Here you are. Click to embiggen.

  <title>Three semesters left.</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Had a talk with my adviser today about what I have left to graduate. With a year and a half to go, I'm looking at 30 credit hours, minimum, left.

Conceivably, that's a single year, with an early graduation, and 15 hours a semester. In reality, that's not something I need to do. I'm not in a hurry.

My plan is to take 12 credit hours, the minimum, for the next three semesters, which will knock out all my silly gen-ed requirements (ugh, philosophy) as well as some upper-level computer science level classes.

This also leaves room for, give or take, six hours of completely free credits. Credits that I need to stay a full-time student (important for scholarship reasons) but not for anything else.

I will probably end up filling that with more computer science courses. Might as well, right? But I have the room, and can make the time, for something less useful but more fun, like a WWII class, or an art class, or something completely different.

I'm really glad that everything worked out well. Dual-enrollment in high school, as well as taking 34 credits last year, put me ahead of where I need to be, and that's right where I want to be.

This also gives me plenty of room to continue working at Hudl through next semester, which is probably the best way to get computer science knowledge and experience, as well as cash in pocket.

So, a good day!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Emojis Suck, an Android Keyboard Adventure</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/emojis-suck-an-android-keyboard-adventure/</link>
  <pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 18:47:02 +0000</pubDate>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, if you have an Android phone like myself, and you use the default keyboard like myself, and you're on Kit Kat, the latest update, like myself, then your texting screen looks something like this:

<a href="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/googleboard.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-484" src="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/googleboard.png" alt="googleboard" width="360" height="640" /></a>

Which is okay. It functions as a keyboard. But, and this is the largest problem by far, that completely fucking asinine emoticon button is cornered between the backspace key and the period key, which are probably the second- and third-most pressed buttons on the keyboard, after spacebar.

And if you graze the emoticon button, then the backspace key moves. So if you're typing fast, you can't even delete all the happy faces and anchors you just typed without seriously hunting for the stupid thing.

This button didn't use to exist all the time, but now it does, and it's pissed me off enough that I've gone looking for another keyboard, because that's a thing you can do with Android. So I went off to Google and found four hip new keyboards, collected from a couple different posts, for trying.

First was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whirlscape.minuumkeyboard">Minuum</a>, a tiny tiny keyboard that prides itself on maintaining maximum screen real estate. There are only like 10 buttons, and you let the autocorrect do the rest. It's an interesting concept. Ultimately, though, it was really hard for me to hunt for letters, and adding symbols is very nontrivial. I don't want a learning curve for my keyboard. Next!

Next was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appalladium.android.dextr">Dextr</a>, a "nu" idea for keyboards. Seriously, go click on that link, and tell me how completely arbitrary that layout looks. The letters are laid out in alphabetical order, and the edge letters are too close to the edge of the screen for me to hit them reliably (I have an OtterBox on my phone, because I drop it sometimes). It seems like something that <em>could maybe</em> work if you took the time to learn it, but again, that's not the goal. Next!

Third was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey">SwiftKey</a>, which is a fairly straightforward alternative keyboard. It's best known for its Swype features, but has other simple features like being able to move and resize it, as well as silly features like applying themes and syncing your autocorrect data to the cloud. I played with it for a while, it was fine, though I didn't feel it offered anything over the default keyboard (the emoticon button is still kind of there, too, but you have to hold the enter key).

Fourth was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cootek.smartinputv5">TouchPal</a>. Don't be led astray by the app name, it really has very little to do with emojis in its free form. I've seen TouchPal described as a keyboard with too many features for its own good, but honestly you can turn off almost anything, so it ends up just requiring slightly more configuration out of the box. Here's a shot of the same message link as above, but with the TouchPal keyboard:

<a href="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/singlekey.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-486" src="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/singlekey.png?w=168" alt="singlekey" width="360" height="640" /></a>

&nbsp;

So right away you notice there's lots of buttons at the top. These are sort of customizable, and actually the part I like the least about TouchPal. The hand lets you access settings (neat) as well as themes (don't care) and the store (don't care). The EN icon lets you switch keyboards and languages (more on that in a second). The &lt;I&gt; gives you four arrow keys and a host of select/copy/paste buttons, which are fantastic. You won't use them much, but man is selecting exact text hard on a small screen. The + just lets you add other shortcuts, which I don't remember and aren't important. (The V shrinks the keyboard.)

The number/symbol pad is laid out well, in my opinion, it has numbers in the num pad format, instead of across the top row. There is no possible way to access emoticons from this screen. In fact I don't even remember where they where, or where they could be. They're just gone.

Already this seems good enough for me. There are a couple small tweaks you can make to autocorrect and things that are nice. Nothing that would change my decision but they certainly reinforce it. You've sold me. So what's behind the EN button?

Well, you can actually swap keyboard layouts in the same language. If you had a flip phone with texting years back, you're familiar with T9, which was <em>the</em> way to text on a phone without a keyboard. You just clicked the buttons in the right order and the phone's dictionary figured out what you were trying to say. There's a T9 option, which I didn't take a picture of but looks like you'd expect.

What completely blows me away is this intermediate mode, termed T+:

<a href="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/doublekey.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-487" src="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/doublekey.png?w=168" alt="doublekey" width="360" height="640" /></a>

For a person with fat fingers who types fast, this layout is a godsend. I think I've had to pick the second guessed result, instead of the first, maybe once in the last day or so. It is so incredibly tight. Sometimes it's even smart enough to split up two words you've typed back to back (sometimes I miss the space bar).

If you're that person, and you also like to throw in non-dictionary words that you could conceivably reuse (like "Spelunky", for example), then it is <em>exactly</em> two buttons presses to switch back into full-keyboard mode, where you can type your word normally, and it is <em>exactly</em> one button press after you've completed your word to add it to your personal dictionary. (If you <em>don't </em>want to save a word, like "aaaahhhh!", then you don't need to dismiss any dialogs or click on anything special, you just press twice to switch keyboards, type your garbage word, then keep typing or switch keyboards again.)

Spoiler: that person is <em>me</em>, and maybe it's <em>you</em>, and maybe you should pick up <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cootek.smartinputv5">TouchPal</a> if you have an Android phone and you hate the emoticon button, or you have fat fingers, or you just want to be like me in all the small ways.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Let's revisit Kenny Bell's Wisconsin block.</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you don't know what I'm talking about or don't remember, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5964960/nebraskas-kenny-bell-delivered-the-best-legal-block-in-college-football-this-season-so-of-course-he-was-flagged-for-it">this Deadspin article</a> covers it pretty well. (And plays it in slow-motion, which is fantastic.)

Let's dial up the original gif, in all its glory:

<a href="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/kenny-bell.gif"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-497 size-full" src="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/kenny-bell.gif" alt="Kenny Bell" width="424" height="327" /></a>

Fantastic. Now, what happens if we, ah, take Kenny out?

<a href="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/not-actually-kenny-bell.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-498" src="https://samuelthomaservin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/not-actually-kenny-bell.gif" alt="not actually Kenny Bell" width="424" height="327" /></a>

Not only does this prove even harder that this was a technically clean hit, it also looks like something out of goddamn <em>Paranormal Activity</em>.

Happy Halloween!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>"Baseball is boring."</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I found this article in the Atlantic that takes a bunch of baseball stats, does some analysis on them, and basically sets out to explain why baseball is becoming less and less interesting, and why less and less people are tuning in to watch it. You can find that link <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/baseball-offensive-drought-and-camera-technology/379443/?single_page=true">here</a>.

It's a fine article. It makes some good points. I don't fully disagree with it. I showed it to my dad, and he had some strong opinions on it, and I wanted to post them because I think they're really interesting to read through. My dad's been watching and listening to baseball since he was a kid, so he has a wider perspective on this. I'll let him do the talking (barely edited for clarity).
<blockquote>I read this and wanted to reach through the screen to punch the writer.  Yes, power numbers are down and it can be attributed to fewer juiced batters.  Also, more interleague play takes a few DHs out of at-bats.  Yes, umpires are calling the “low” strike more consistently, but there are players (like Matt Adams in St. Louis) that are not only accustomed to the low strike, they thrive on it.  The strike zone means nothing in this equation.  The near-extinction of gorilla ball is a difference maker.  Someone in the comments [of the Atlantic article] made mention of aluminum bats, but with the BBCOR standards, alloy bats play like wood.  There’s an outcry about the lack of home runs in college ball, particularly the CWS.  People don’t want to see refined pitching, speedy defenses, and calculated risks.  They want cavemen with clubs.

As to the popularity, baseball is not a violent game.  Football is.  Americans like violence.  With the rules changes that nearly eliminate home plate collisions, you make the play at the plate less exciting, less chest-thumping.  There is more of an emphasis on speed and defense.  You've heard, perhaps, of Whitey Herzog, onetime manager of Kansas City and St. Louis.  Hey built his teams around a philosophy that has come to be known as “Whiteyball.”  You’ve heard of Moneyball, this is similar.  Pitchers pitch to contact, defense is fast and agile.  You had players like Ozzie Smith, Willie McGee, Tommy Herr, Terry Pendleton, and Vince Coleman—players whose first step was so quick that they could chase down a ball and make a play no matter where it was.  On the offense, guys drew walks, infield singles, then stole bases.  Station-to-station baseball.  Even catchers bunted.  There was the occasional Jack Clark, the power threat at first base, but mostly small-ball.  I once watched a game where Vince Coleman walked to start the game, stole second on the next pitch, and scored on an infield single (yes, infield, yes, from second) by Willie McGee.  Seven pitches into the game, one run and no outs with no balls leaving the infield.  It’s hard to defend raw speed.

One of the less-talked-about things that hurts baseball is radio.  You can’t miss a day without a baseball game on cable.  But if you don’t have cable, that dynamic is different.  If you go back in time when baseball had fewer teams and more dedicated fans, the difference was radio.  Yep, yep, yep—radio.  If you couldn't be at the game, you listened to it on the radio.  Nowadays there are few games on the radio.  More emphasis is put on TV and streaming media.  You don’t reach the impoverished areas of southwest Detroit, south Chicago, or south-central Los Angeles with streaming media.  You reach it with <i>radio.</i>  Satellite radio has games on all the time—for a price.  I don’t know too many ten-year-olds that have satellite radio.  Even fewer who listen to ballgames with their dad.

MLB already has gone to a flat-seamed ball.  It reduces the break on a curve.  Makes it easier to hit.  In the 70s, they made the mound shorter, made it easier for batters to see and catch up with the fastball.  I think dropping the mound too much makes this look like slow-pitch softball.

No national stars?  Sure there are, one for every team.  The problem is that there was an era of expansion in which there were barely enough players to staff and now there is a dilution of talent between Low-A, High-A, AA, AAA, Fall League, Winter Ball, and The Show.  There are sooooo many players out there that need reps and exposure and to play.  It’s hard to have a star when you have four guys able to take his position if he gets the sniffles.  Last year, Matt Adams was hitting .485 after about 100 at-bats and was not playing every day.  The Cards also had the highest scoring offense in the NL.  Everybody was producing.  Adams had an 0-fer and sat out three days.  Meanwhile, Allen Craig had an historic season.  Two guys nobody had heard of last year ended up being just what the team needed—after letting Carlos Beltran go in the offseason and trading David Freese (yes, World Series hero) a season after letting MVP Albert Pujols go.  Stars are expensive and mobile.  If you develop, you don’t need stars, you've got a guy at AAA on speed dial.

This turned into more of a rant than I had expected.  I, for one, enjoy the calculated chess match that is current major-league ball.  20-16 games devastate pitching staffs and can ruin a road trip.  4-3 games over after 2 ½ hours are thrilling.  I like football and hockey, but baseball will always be my true love.</blockquote>
The second-to-last paragraph is probably my favorite, and I think contributes heavily to the problems facing the MLB. Name recognition is hard enough with huge rotating staffs, let alone guys that switch teams. There are relatively few interesting plays (as in Whiteyball) because everyone is just that consistent and good. They have to be, or they won't be in the majors long.

I have a lot of trouble watching baseball on TV. Even if it's one of my teams! This is the saddest thing to me. Three years ago, I was watching a World Series game — a <em>World Series game! — </em>in which <em>my Cardinals</em> were playing, and it was a close game... and I was drifting off every ten minutes as the game dragged on for more than four hours.

Maybe I'm just not patient. Maybe I'm not a "true fan." But heck if I am going to try extraordinarily hard to watch a sport on TV if I've gotta hit the caffeine just to make it through.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Communication at GitHub and the Sparano Scale™</title>
  <link>http://samuelthomaservin.wordpress.com/2014/11/20/communication-at-github-and-the-sparano-scale/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Two links; ribbed, for your pleasure.

The first one is a list of 15 rules for communicating at GitHub. Like everything else involved in communication, they're not hard and fast rules, but they're well-written and I consciously try to follow some of them at my own workplace. That link is here: <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/">http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/</a>

The second link is a bit sillier: it's a way to categorize everything ever into four easy-to-remember categories: Not Good™, which implies that a thing is so bad as to not even be considered good (this is the second-largest category); Not Great™, which implies that a thing has good qualities but has not jumped the fence (this is the largest category); Good™, which implies a thing is overall pleasing and positive but may have minor flaws or mistakes (the second-smallest category); and Great™, which implies a fantastic idea, masterful execution, and being near what you might consider perfection (which is not a Category™ but you might push it yourself). That link is here: <a href="http://oxidedesign.com/the-sparano-scale/">http://oxidedesign.com/the-sparano-scale/</a>

Enjoy.]]></content:encoded>
