title: Friendly-to-play: is Hearthstone or Team Fortress 2 easier?

Two of my favorite computer games are Team Fortress 2 and Hearthstone. Ultimately very different games (one a team-based FPS and one a CCG), they have one thing in common: they're completely free-to-play.

As more and more Hearthstone cards are released, getting into HS gets harder and harder, and I wonder how Blizzard is going to address this going forward. On the other hand, TF2 is moderately stagnant as far as new competitive content goes, and Valve had a very different approach for a game with a very different life cycle.

So I want to talk about some of the differences between these two games, and ultimately decide which game is friendlier to a brand-new player.

Let's start with the evolution of **Team Fortress 2.**

TF2 was released in late 2007, as part of the Orange Box, or you could buy it separately for twenty bucks. There were 9 classes, every class had 3 or so weapons, and there were only 6 official maps. The learning curve was essentially trying to decipher the mechanics, and memorize the maps.

For a brand-new player, TF2 had some difficult-to-explain mechanics, but great care was taken to distinguish and add character to the different classes, and their different weapons. Some of this is noted in the developer commentary that ships with the game. Essentially, every class's silhouette and animations were chosen for easy, reflexive recognition, even without seeing direct details like the logo on their shoulder.

Maybe the hardest part was understanding the mechanics of the Spy class, and indeed the Spy class was probably tweaked the most in the coming months and years. A character that can disguise as the opponent and turn invisible is going to confuse new players no matter what you do, and this surely put some people off of the game. But this was the major hiccup.

In April 2008 the Gold Rush update hit servers, which introduced three new weapons for the Medic class. This was, overall, a positive change. Medics had more ways to influence the game, there were more strategies available to teams, and general Medic play got a bump, which was good for the game.

Four months later, two more class updates had hit, giving the Pyro and Heavy new weapons. Which is fine. This is fair. Pyros gained more burst potential, and Heavies gained some more usable secondary weapons.

Gradually, every class got an update, and a handful of other weapons and mechanics were added over the next several years. Every class had at least one alternate weapon in every slot that was relevant, every class could be built in slightly different way, and the game slowly exploded.

If you had been playing the game for a while, or read a significant amount about the game online, you could handle everything. Knowing to equip Heavy's Sandvich. Understanding how to optimize your Ambassador shots. How the minicrits of Jarate interacted with buildings and other minicrits and critical hits. How item sets (gasp!) worked, and what their advantages were.

In June 2011, TF2 went free-to-play. Free-to-play accounts (those who had never spent money on the game) were limited to 50 weapons instead of a large amount of weapons and items, but could comfortably play the game for quite a while before this limitation ever hit, and the buy-in was only five dollars.

This update came with, most notably, another medigun for the Medic, as well as a huge amount of weapons for most other classes. At this point, there were around 45 official maps in a variety of game modes, at least two unlockable weapons for most weapon slots, and a slew of purely cosmetic items and effects.

I think you understand where I'm going with this. Let me fast-forward to today. It's April 2015. There are 76 official maps across 15 game modes (to be fair, four game modes have only 1 map). There are somewhere on the order of 200 weapons (though some share stats).

A small Training Mode exists, and explains the Engineer and Spy classes enough to get started, which is good. But TF2 is really difficult to fully comprehend.

Killcams tell you what weapon killed you, by default. It is reacting to these weapon choices, and expecting certain weapons ahead of time, that is impossible to communicate, and makes a full picture something of a pipe dream.

I'm not hating on TF2 here. Killcams work wonders for communicating information, particularly against long-range kills. There exists a healthy, if too-small, amount of information inside the game itself around weapons and maps. And the online community around TF2 is enormous and finding guides and help is pretty easy.
