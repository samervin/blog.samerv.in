title: Friendly-to-play: is Hearthstone or Team Fortress 2 easier?

Two of my favorite computer games are Team Fortress 2 and Hearthstone. Ultimately very different games (one a team-based FPS and one a CCG), they have one thing in common: they're completely free-to-play.

As more and more Hearthstone cards are released, getting into HS gets harder and harder, and I wonder how Blizzard is going to address this going forward. On the other hand, TF2 is moderately stagnant as far as new competitive content goes, and Valve had a very different approach for a game with a very different life cycle.

So I want to talk about some of the differences between these two games, and ultimately decide which game is friendlier to a brand-new player.

I'll start with this: **what items are considered "necessary" or are strongly important in TF2?**

I'm going to try and keep this as brief as possible. Obviously it is to your advantage to have all the weapons at your disposal, but some offer alternative playstyles while some significantly increase a class's general performance.

For the Scout: the *Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol*, *Bonk!*, the *Boston Basher*, and the *Atomizer* either offer an alternative ability that isn't duplicated anywhere else (*Bonk!*) or are simply more reliable than their counterparts. Scout does reasonably well with his default loadout, though.

All the Soldier's banners open up alternative abilities, but the stock shotgun is still the best for 1 vs. 1 combat. A Soldier really only needs a *Disciplinary Action* or perhaps *Escape Plan* to be on par with other Soldiers, who won't use stock melee in 99% of cases.

Pyro is tricky: there are a lot more combo plays with the *Degreaser*, but stock flamethrower is better at lower skill levels. The *Flare Gun*, perhaps the most balanced sidegrade in the game, enables more interesting Pyro play but I wouldn't call it necessary. What *is* necessary is a better melee weapon: previously *Axtinguisher* was the go-to, but *Powerjack* (or perhaps a *Homewrecker*) are also useful. The Pyro should *never* use his stock melee, basically.

Vanilla Demoman is the most powerful class in the game, full stop. You might want to mess around with the Demoknight unlocks, or an alternative grenade launcher, but this is one class you can play with no loadout changes for your whole TF2 career.

Heavy needs a lot of help. His shotgun and fists are outclasses by nearly every unlock. *Sandvich* is almost always taken in the secondary slot, and the *Gloves of Running Urgently* are almost always taken in the melee slot. Acquiring these is crucial to playing Heavy well.

The Engineer is fairly solid, though you'll have trouble playing anything but slow defense with the stock loadout. The *Wrangler*, in the secondary slot, is great for defense (and offense, if you're good), the *Jag* is slightly better than the wrench at all times, and the *Gunslinger* enables the offensive twitchy Engineer, which is an important niche to fill.

Keeping the stock *Medi Gun* on Medic is fine, and certainly the most reliable. The alternative medi guns, especially the *Kritzkrieg* and *Quick-Fix*, can be better on defense or offense respectively, though they're less reliable and certainly not necessary. What's crucial is a melee unlock for the Medic: most take *Ubersaw*, some take *Vita-Saw* or *Amputator*. All are upgrades to stock.

Snipers usually take *Jarate* as it enables team-play as well as a strong chance of surviving 1 vs. 1 combat, when paired with the *Bushwacka*. These two items grant strong abilities to the Sniper and are extremely important, though certainly not required.

Spies are tough. Most Spies don't run stock revolver, though which revolver they take depends heavily on playstyle. *Your Eternal Reward* opens up new options for the Spy, but is difficult to use. *Spy-cicle* is often taken, but may leave a Spy stranded against other enemies. The *Dead Ringer* is probably the most important alternative playstyle, and isn't required for Spy play but adds a powerful tool to his arsenal.

So, bottom line, there are 12 to 14 weapon slots, out of 27 or so, that ought to be filled with a non-stock weapon for better gameplay. That's around half. Playing Scout, Soldier, or Demoman (or perhaps Medic) is relatively straightforward, and you don't gain large advantages by getting new weapons. The other classes need help from unlocks to be effective (Heavy, Pyro), or to greatly increase effectiveness (Engineer, Sniper, Spy).

But you can still compete at lower skill levels. Being a bad Engineer or Medic or Demoman still means that you're building Sentries, healing your teammates, or spamming grenades, and that's good.

So let's move back out to
